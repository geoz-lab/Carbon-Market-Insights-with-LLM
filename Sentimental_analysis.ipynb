This will drive innovation to reduce the carbon intensity of existing fuels and develop the next generation of cleaner fuels, ultimately reducing the state’s reliance on petroleum. Transportation alone accounts for 40 percent of California’s Greenhouse Gas emissions.\\n\"The Low Carbon Fuel Standard is an essential part of California’s program to move away from dirty fuels and toward a clean energy future,” according to Air Resources Board Chairman Mary D. Nichols. “These changes streamline the program. They ensure that we accurately account for every gram of carbon released during the extraction and transportation of unrefined fossil fuels, no matter where they come from.\"\\nOne key amendment will improve how the regulation accounts for the carbon intensity of crude oils. The carbon intensity of crudes can vary significantly with heavy crudes generally having a higher carbon footprint.  The proposed amendments require that the carbon intensity of crudes be fully accounted for just like other fuels under the program.  The provision also incentivizes innovation by providing credits for specific actions to reduce the carbon intensity of crude oil.\\nThe amendments also clarify which regulated parties receive low carbon fuel credits for the electricity used to charge electric vehicles.\\nFor residential charging, the electric utilities will be eligible for the credits, as they appear best suited to send the credit value back to electric vehicle owners in the form of rebates, time-of-use rates or other incentives. For public access charging, companies that install and service charging units in public settings such as malls or parking structures may receive the related credits.  Finally, businesses that install private access charging stations for employees, or fleet operators that operate at least three electric vehicles may also be eligible for credits.\\nRegulated facilities began operating under the Low Carbon Fuel Standard in April of 2010. The Air Resources Board estimates the Low Carbon Fuel Standard will achieve 15 million metric tons of greenhouse gas reduction by 2020. The standard is also expected to lead to replacement of the equivalent of up to four billion gallons of gasoline by then. The Low Carbon Fuel Standard will drive the development of new fuels to help clean California’s air and protect the state from dramatic price spikes seen with petroleum.\\nThe Low Carbon Fuel Standard is designed to work with California’s new Cap-and-Trade Program and the upcoming Advanced Clean Car regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions now, and for decades into the future. \\nAll documents related to these amendments are available at: https://www.arb.ca.gov/regact/2011/lcfs2011/lcfs2011.htm.'},\n",

These credits are roughly the same as removing 1 million cars from the roads for a year in terms of preventing greenhouse gases from entering the atmosphere. \\n“This program is succeeding: California has a thriving market for new, low-carbon fuels, there is an ample supply of low-carbon fuel credits, and the marketplace and the regulation provide businesses with the flexibility needed to comply,” said CARB Chair Mary D. Nichols. “The Low Carbon Standard is fully delivering on its promise to drive innovation and create a thriving market that delivers clean, low-carbon fuels for the trucks, buses and cars in California.”\\nThe Low Carbon Fuel Standard took effect in 2011, and is designed to lower carbon emissions generated at every stage of a fuel’s production. In California, transportation is the single largest sector for climate impact, responsible for 37 percent of the state’s total greenhouse gas emissions.  \\nThe transportation sector is also responsible for the majority of the state’s air pollution which adversely impacts public health. Thus, by encouraging the production and use of clean fuels in California the LCFS is reducing emissions of other pollutants of concern.\\nTo date renewable and low-carbon fuels rewarded under the LCFS have displaced 5.3 billion gallons of gasoline, and 1.2 billion gallons of diesel fuel. Overall, the program has generated 16.55 million credits with a current balance (that is, over-compliance) of 7.41 million credits. Each credit is the equivalent of 1 metric ton of carbon dioxide. \\nThe 2015 annual reports demonstrate exceedingly high levels of overall compliance.  Of the 52 entities who sell high carbon fuels, and have an obligation under the program, only a single company – Astra Oil Company LLC – ended the compliance period with a small shortfall of 337 credits and will be required to purchase the necessary credits from the LCFS Credit Clearance Market (CCM) between June 1 and July 31, 2016.  \\nThe CCM is a cost containment mechanism introduced into the regulation last year and allows a company to purchase credits offered for sale by producers who have generated a surplus.

It shows 100 percent compliance with the regulation.\\n“Full compliance is further evidence that the LCFS is working as designed,” said Executive Officer Richard Corey. “This means that cleaner, renewable fuels encouraged by the program are now replacing hundreds of millions of gallons of fossil fuel every year and significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions, as well as other pollutants.”\\nThe LCFS requires transportation fuel producers to reduce the carbon intensity of their fuels 10 percent by 2020. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are counted at all stages of production, known as “well-to-wheel” life cycle analysis.\\nThe LCFS was developed to help California achieve AB 32’s 2020 reduction target of a return to 1990 levels of GHG emissions. The program is also important for reaching the 2030 GHG reduction target set by the Governor and the Legislature. That new target requires GHG emissions 40 percent below 1990 levels. \\nThe program is providing consumers with an increasing volume of cleaner fuels. As an example, in 2016, renewable liquid fuels displaced over 400 million gallons of diesel, and more than 80 million gallons were displaced by renewable natural gas. There are 224 companies reporting in the LCFS. Of those, 54 generated credit deficits for fuels with carbon intensity above the desired baseline and were required to make up for the shortfall. All obligations were fulfilled.\\nIn 2016, the industry continued to over-comply with the regulation, generating 9.1 million credits against 6.8 million deficits. \\nSince the start of the program in 2011 it has generated credits representing 25.6 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emission reductions. That equals over-compliance of  9.7 million metric tons, and means that GHG emission reductions are occurring ahead of schedule.'},\n",

              "  'content': \"The Air Resources Board today re-adopted a Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS), which requires a 10 percent reduction by 2020 in the carbon intensity of transportation fuels. The LCFS, a pillar supporting the state’s efforts to fight climate change, delivers more clean fuels for Californians, and reduces emissions of greenhouse gases and other air pollutants.\\n“Today’s action builds on years of successful implementation and will continue reducing carbon emissions from the transportation sector. Transportation is the largest source of greenhouse gases in the state,” said Air Resources Board Chair Mary D. Nichols. “This program is a key element of California’s plans to enact Governor Brown’s Executive Order mandating a 50 percent cut in petroleum use by 2030.” \\nThe LCFS is an important tool in California’s efforts to reduce the impacts of climate change by spurring innovation in an array of cleaner fuels. The program requires that transportation fuels used in California meet a baseline target for carbon intensity. That target is reduced each year. If a product is above the annual carbon intensity target, the fuel incurs deficits. If a product is below that target, the fuel generates credits which may be used later for compliance, or sold to other producers who have deficits. So far, fuel producers are over-complying with the regulation.\\nCarbon intensity is determined through a life cycle analysis measuring the amount of carbon generated during the extraction, production, transportation, and combustion of a fuel. The LCFS does not require use of any specific fuel, only that regulated parties find a blend of fuels and credits that will meet the declining target each year.\\nThe LCFS is a pillar supporting California’s effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with AB 32’s 2020 target and to achieve further reductions beyond that.  The regulation is also intended to spur innovation in transportation fuels and to reduce California’s dependence on petroleum.\\nThe decline in the LCFS carbon intensity targets was frozen due to a legal challenge. To address the court’s ruling and to strengthen the program, the Air Resources Board readopted the LCFS regulation following public testimony delivered yesterday at the first of a two-day Board meeting. \\nThe readopted version of the LCFS includes a number of modifications developed with stakeholder input. These include:\\nIncorporating additional cost containment in response to stakeholder concerns about possible price spikes by including a mechanism to cap LCFS credit prices;\\nStreamlining the application process for alternative fuel producers seeking a carbon intensity score;\\nImproving the process for earning LCFS credits by charging electric vehicles.\\nAlternative Diesel Fuels\\nThe Board today also adopted a regulation governing alternative diesel fuels (ADF). The regulation puts in place a three-step process beginning in 2016 to create a path to bring cleaner diesel substitutes into the market. This regulation also establishes requirements and fuel specifications for biodiesel to ensure the emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) from biodiesel use will not increase, and will be reduced over time.  Biodiesel and other ADFs can help producers achieve their target under the LCFS.\\nOther programs that will result in a decreased use of petroleum while helping achieve the 40 percent reduction of greenhouse gases by 2030 as called for by Governor Brown include the advanced clean car regulations that deliver greater fuel efficiency, the zero-emission vehicle mandate putting more electric and hydrogen powered cars on the streets, and the State's efforts under SB 375 to develop more livable, walkable communities and improve public transit.\\nCalifornia’s greenhouse gas reduction programs achieve additional benefits. For example, the reduction of greenhouse gases as a result of reduced petroleum use often coincides with reductions of air pollutants that increase the severity of asthma and cardiovascular disease, and ultimately cost Californians their lives.\"},\n",

All three companies violated provisions of the Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS), which is critical part of California’s greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction efforts.\\n“The Low Carbon Fuel Standard is critical to California’s effort to fight the worst impacts of climate change, achieve its mandated GHG reductions, and to provide consumers with more clean fuel choices” said CARB Executive Officer Richard Corey. “It is not a new regulation and there is no good reason for compliance failures.”\\nSK Energy Americas agreed to a $395,000 penalty for failure to meet the carbon intensity target for 2014.\\nAlon USA and subsidiary, Paramount Petroleum have agreed to pay a $300,000 civil judgment for failure to accurately report fuel transactions.\\nKern Oil & Refining agreed to a penalty of $90,000 and forfeiture of 15,838 LCFS credits for misreporting the type of low carbon fuel it sold (These credits are currently worth nearly two million dollars.)\\nCARB first approved the LCFS in 2010 with compliance starting in 2011. The LCFS requires that companies producing fuel for use in California lower the carbon in their production process 10 percent by 2020.\\nThe regulation requires that fuel suppliers meet, on an annual basis, a clean fuel target for the vehicle fuels they sell in California. If an individual fuel they supply is below that annual target its carbon emissions are lower and it generates marketable credits for the producer; fuels above that number generate deficits. If producers are unable to supply enough low-carbon fuels in a year to meet the annual target, they must acquire credits from other fuel suppliers in the marketplace to make up the deficit. SK Energy Americas agreed to pay the $395,000 penalty because it failed to cover its deficit in 2014.\\nAll producers are required to accurately report the types of fuel produced for sale in California and transactions for sale of that fuel. CARB took Alon and Paramount to court for their failure to accurately report its sales. Kern Oil was fined for inaccurate reporting of fuel type, and in addition to the fine CARB invalidated the credits associated with the misreported batches of fuel.\\nThe LCFS is a tool critical to achieving California’s 2020 GHG emission reduction goal of a return to 1990 levels. It will also be important in reaching the legislatively mandated 2030 reduction goal of 40 percent below 1990 levels and 2050 target of reductions 40 percent below 2030 levels.\\nCARB is amending the LCFS starting in 2021 to require fuel producers to reduce emissions an additional 20 percent by 2030. The amendments will also bring more alternative fuels, such as jet fuels, into the program, and add a third-party verification program. Another amendment will create a variety of credits and partial credits for electric vehicle electrification to promote development of electric vehicle infrastructure called for in Governor Brown’s Executive Order B-48-18'},\n",

The 2017 Compliance Report for the Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) shows 100 percent compliance with the regulation.\\n“This is great news and further evidence that California is on the right track in the fight to address climate change and ensure everyone has clean air to breathe,” said CARB Executive Officer Richard Corey. “This program gives consumers more fuel choices and is driving the development of a burgeoning clean-fuel market in California”.\\nThe program considers greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at all stages of production of a fuel, from pump or field to wheel. It was originally developed to support a return to 1990 levels of climate-changing gases by 2020, as required by AB 32, the 2006 landmark climate bill. Currently fuel producers who sell their product in California must lower the amount of overall carbon in their fuels 10 percent by 2020.\\nNow that a new climate target of a 40 percent reduction of climate-changing gases is in place for 2030, CARB staff has proposed a further reduction in the LCFS to reach a 20 percent decrease of carbon in vehicle fuels to help meet that target. That reduction will help provide the basis for another overall reduction of an additional 40 percent by 2050.\\nThe program provides consumers with an increasing volume and variety of cleaner fuels. As an example, in 2017, renewable liquid fuels displaced over 500 million gallons of diesel, and more than 100 million gallons were displaced by renewable natural gas. Electricity displaced about 75 million gallons of petroleum.\\nThe 100 percent compliance rate is further proof of the success of the program.  Of the 262 companies reporting under the program, 55 generated deficits for supplying fuels that were dirtier than the 2017 program benchmark. They were required to make up for their shortfall by purchasing credits from clean fuel providers. All other companies brought cleaner fuels to market—fuels that were below the carbon-intensity baseline.\\nSince its start in 2011 the program has generated credits representing a total reduction of 35.8 million metric tons of climate-changing gases. That equals an over-compliance of 9.8 million metric tons, meaning that that GHG emission reductions are occurring ahead of schedule. The clean fuels also reduced emissions of toxic pollutants as well as those that cause smog.\\nGoing forward, CARB staff has proposed a number of amendments to the LCFS besides the 20 percent reduction target. All the amendments are to help achieve the overall 2030 GHG reduction target of 40 percent below 1990 levels.\\nThe proposed amendments include credit generation for new innovative technologies such as hydrogen and electricity fueling stations, carbon capture and sequestration projects and cleaner alternative jet fuels. Other proposed amendments improve crediting for innovative actions at petroleum refineries, and establish an independent third-party verification and verifier accreditation system to ensure accuracy of LCFS reported data.\\nThe amendments were developed with extensive input from industry and the public.

              "  'content': 'The California Air Resources Board (CARB) today approved changes to the Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) designed to make the program a more versatile, comprehensive tool in the fight against climate change. \\nSince 2011, the LCFS has been a cornerstone of California’s effort to reduce greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions and has spurred innovation in low-carbon transportation fuels such as hydrogen, electricity and biodiesel. Last year, the LCFS resulted in more than two billion gallons of petroleum and natural gas being replaced with cleaner, renewable transportation fuels.\\nThe standard currently requires a 10 percent reduction in the “carbon intensity” of California’s transportation fuels by 2020. Carbon intensity is determined by the amount of carbon emitted throughout a fuel’s entire life cycle, from extraction or production to combustion.\\nThe amendments approved today by the Board require a 20 percent reduction in carbon intensity by 2030, the most stringent requirement in the nation. The new requirement aligns with California’s overall 2030 target of reducing climate changing emissions 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030, which was set by Senate Bill 32 and signed by Governor Brown in 2016. \\n“These amendments will take California’s climate fight up another notch,” said Board Chair Mary D. Nichols. “The addition of credits for alternative aviation fuels makes the program more flexible and adds a major source of potential greenhouse gas reductions. Using some of the credits to give a new car buyer a break on electric transportation will provide a clear incentive for zero emission vehicle sales and infrastructure, as requested by the legislature and Governor Brown.”\\nIncentives for ZEV Sales and Infrastructure\\nThe amendments incentivize development of additional zero emission vehicle infrastructure and the sale of electric and hydrogen vehicles, building on utilities ability to collect LCFS credits based on charging, and adding provisions to jump start infrastructure installation through credits generated based on the expected capacity of fast charging and hydrogen refueling stations.\\nThe LCFS program is implemented using a system of tradeable credits, each of which is equivalent to one metric ton of carbon. Credits are generated by producers of cleaner fuels and can be sold to producers whose product will not meet the program’s declining benchmark for carbon intensity. \\nIn the case of utilities, credits are generated based on charging for zero emission vehicles. Part of the proceeds from sale of those utility credits will be used to increase the rebates from utilities to drivers purchasing electric vehicles. \\nThe amendments also restructure the various utility vehicle rebate programs into a single pool so application and payment processes are uniform regardless of which utility is involved, and so the rebates can be made available through small utilities as well as large ones. \\nProtocol for Carbon Capture & Storage\\nToday’s CARB vote also puts in place the most stringent regulatory protocol in the country to set requirements for carbon capture and storage (CCS). CCS is a process that collects carbon emissions before they reach the atmosphere and injects them into permanent underground storage sites. This process should be particularly useful to ethanol producers, as it has the potential to reduce their carbon intensity by up to an additional 40 percent.\\nThe international aviation market is responsible for about two percent of the world’s GHG emissions. With today’s CARB vote, alternative, or renewable, aviation fuels may now also generate LCFS credits. Producers of those fuels will be permitted to voluntarily opt into the LCFS program.\\nThe program will also begin using CARB-trained and accredited third-party verifiers to provide additional verification of reported reductions in carbon intensity. This process will be similar to the rigorous verification standards for emission reductions in the cap-and-trade program.\\nLCFS compliance began in January of 2011. The amendments approved today follow a public process that lasted two years and included 22 workshops, multiple draft documents and numerous one-on-one stakeholder meetings.\\nThe LCFS is part of a comprehensive set of programs that California relies on to reduce carbon emissions and fight climate change. Others include cap-and-trade, the Advanced Clean Car Program, the Renewables Portfolio Standard and the Short-Lived Climate Pollutant strategy.\\nToday’s public hearing was the second hearing on these amendments, which take effect on January 1, 2019.'},\n",

The 2018 data also shows fuel producers are in 100 percent compliance with the LCFS.\\n“Renewable and bio-diesel, renewable natural gas, ethanol, and electricity are all seeing growth under the LCFS,” said CARB Executive officer Richard W. Corey. “Californians have the widest variety of cleaner low-carbon vehicles available anywhere in the country. The LCFS is catalyzing investments in these cleaner alternative fuels, providing consumers with more choices, and reducing emissions of toxic pollutants and greenhouse gases. These are key reasons why other states and nations are establishing similar programs.”\\nThe program aims to reduce the carbon intensity of transportation fuels by considering greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at all stages of production, from extraction to combustion.

California reached that overall goal in 2016.\\nNow a climate target of an additional 40 percent overall reduction of climate-changing gases is in place for 2030, under SB 32. To help California reach that goal, CARB built on the success of the LCFS by doubling the required reduction level and setting a 2030 target for vehicle fuels of 20-percent less carbon than is now found in gasoline and diesel fuel. Those cleaner fuels will displace millions more gallons of fossil fuels, helping pave the way for California to achieve full carbon neutrality by 2045.\\nThe standard provides consumers with a growing variety and volume of cleaner fuels. Renewable liquid fuels – including renewable and biodiesel – displaced over 568 million gallons of diesel in 2018. Nearly 120 million gallons of diesel were displaced by renewable natural gas, and electricity – used to run hundreds of thousands of plug-in cars and trucks – displaced about 96 million gallons of petroleum.\\nThe 100 percent compliance rate is further proof of the success of the program.

The inaccurate information spanned 24 quarterly reports. Tesoro formally acknowledged the mistake in a letter outlining the problems, and worked with CARB to account for all the fuel provided and correct their reports. Because of the company’s cooperation, the settlement is for far less than the maximum possible penalties.\\nThe money from the fine will be deposited in the state Air Pollution Control Fund where it can be appropriated by the legislature for air quality and greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction efforts.\\nThe LCFS encourages the use of cleaner, low-carbon fuels in California. It also encourages the production of those fuels, and therefore, reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.\\nThe LCFS standards are expressed in terms of the \"carbon intensity\" (CI) of gasoline and diesel fuel and their various substitutes. CI is calculated based on the \"life cycle\" greenhouse gas emissions of a fuel. Those emissions include carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen oxide and other greenhouse gas contributors. This life cycle assessment examines the greenhouse gas emissions associated with each step of the production, transportation and use of a given fuel, sometimes referred to as “well-to-wheel” analysis.\\nUnder the LCFS, fuel producers generate deficits or credits based on an annual baseline CI. Fuels with a CI above the baseline create deficits; fuels with a CI below the baseline generate credits.

Since the program launch in November 2020, more than $319 million in rewards have been received by EV buyers. Of the total rewards, 21.2% of incentives went to customers in underserved communities, 10% to customers in low-income communities and another 10% to customers in disadvantaged communities.\\n“The California Clean Fuel Reward provides an easy ‘on-the-hood’ price reduction right at the dealership that lowers the purchase price.

The LCFS is one of several programs developed under AB 32 (the 2006 Global Warming Solutions Act) to cut California’s emissions of climate warming greenhouse gas. Other programs include Cap-and-Trade, which establishes a declining limit to emissions allowed in the state by requiring industry to pay for pollution produced. Newer regulations such as Advanced Clean Trucks and Advanced Clean Fleets put in place a phased-in transition to sell and implement clean truck technology in California, in line with Governor Gavin Newsom’s Executive Order calling for all heavy duty vehicles traveling in the state to be zero emissions by 2045.

It is made from renewable biomass and/or waste. The agreement accelerates solutions to California’s climate and air quality goals by partnering with the aviation industry in emissions reduction efforts, and it supports a commitment by the major U.S. airlines to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, which will require completely transitioning from conventional petroleum-based jet fuel to sustainable alternatives.\\nThis collaboration is an example of California’s partnerships with industry to move toward a clean air future, and one that was made possible by the development of alternative fuels spurred by the state’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard program that provide the industry lower-carbon, sustainable options.\\n“California and the aviation industry are joining forces to tackle emissions head-on,” said Governor Gavin Newsom. “We’ve put the tools in place to incentivize cleaner fuels and spur innovation, creating opportunities like this to radically change how Californians can travel cleaner. This is a major step forward in our work to cut pollution, protect our communities, and build a future of cleaner air and innovative climate solutions.”\\n“California is once again demonstrating that smart climate action is good for the environment and good for business,” said CARB Chair Liane Randolph. “This partnership with the nation’s leading airlines brings the aviation industry onboard to advance a clean air future and will help accelerate development of sustainable fuel options and promote cleaner air travel within the state.”\\n\"A4A is pleased to launch a partnership with CARB focused on protecting the environment, reducing emissions, and increasing the use of SAF in California and across the country,” said Kevin Welsh, Vice President of Environmental Affairs and Chief Sustainability Officer at Airlines for America. “This partnership reflects the type of collaboration between government and the private sector that is necessary to achieve ambitious climate goals, and the agreement announced today reflects the strength of our commitment to a cleaner, more sustainable future for air travel.

Advocacy efforts that support innovative and thoughtful policy solutions are critical to building a more sustainable future of travel,” shared Amelia DeLuca, Chief Sustainability Officer at Delta Air Lines. “SAF is the best-known lever we have to decarbonize aviation, and with around 90% of Delta’s carbon emissions coming from jet fuel, we need as much SAF as we can get. That’s why we’re proud to have current offtake agreements in place to support our use of SAF in California, and why we will continue to work with value chain players and government partners like CARB to accelerate the development of SAF for the future.”\\n“Sustainable aviation fuel plays a critical role in the journey to Alaska Airlines’ aim of net zero carbon emissions by 2040. But there remains significant work to ensure that SAF is commercially viable and available at scale, and we need an industry-wide approach to address this challenge,” said Diana Birkett Rakow, SVP of Public Affairs and Sustainability at Alaska Airlines. “We appreciate CARB working alongside the industry to drive progress for aviation and the SAF ecosystem, and to advance this important energy solution in California and beyond.”'},\n",

This has displaced 320 million metric tons CO2 of gasoline and diesel emissions since the Program’s inception. That’s an amount equivalent 85% of today’s annual statewide greenhouse gas emissions. The growth in the use of renewable fuel is powering needed emissions reductions in the transportation sector.\\n“The proposal approved today strikes a balance between reducing the environmental and health impacts of transportation fuel used in California and ensuring that low-carbon options are available as the state continues to work toward a zero-emissions future,” said CARB Chair Liane Randolph. “Today’s approval increases consumer options beyond petroleum, provides a roadmap for cleaner air, and leverages private sector investment and federal incentives to spur innovation to address climate change and pollution.”\\nThe LCFS is designed to provide the most cost-effective path to support clean fuels and infrastructure. Affordability remains a key consideration for the Board, and it has directed staff to assess any impacts and potential mitigation from today’s adopted amendments on retail gasoline prices every six months and to submit an annual report beginning one year from the effective date of these amendments, and to collaborate with the California Energy Commission in that effort. The program currently limits the pass-through costs companies can shift to consumers by capping the price of credits that high-carbon-intensity fuel producing entities are required to purchase for compliance and allowing banking of credits bought at lower prices. Data from third party commodities markets experts shows the current LCFS pass through to California consumers is $0.10 per gallon of gasoline. This is consistent with the self-reported data by high-carbon-intensity fuel producers, which reflects an LCFS cost pass through to consumers of $0.08 to $0.10 per gallon of gasoline.\\nSupporting Californians\\nMaking electric vehicles more affordable: “The LCFS has also provided hundreds of millions of dollars of beneficial credits and incentives supporting the build-out of EV charging infrastructure and vehicle rebates which lower the upfront costs for drivers,” said a representative from MN8 Energy, which produces renewable energy, in a letter submitted to CARB.\\nExpanding access to charging infrastructure: As of October 10, 2024, there have been a total of 71 hydrogen stations and 749 fast EV charger sites approved under the Hydrogen Refueling Infrastructure (HRI) and (Fast Charging Infrastructure) FCI provisions of LCFS, respectively.\\nReducing health care costs associated with pollution from dirty fuels: CARB estimates $5 billion in savings from avoided health outcomes between 2024 and 2046.\\nIncreasing consumer choices, which drives price competition: “By using market-based policies that ensure the best ideas succeed, we can also maximize impact by marshaling private capital to invest in climate solutions. Fortunately, California already has an excellent example of this kind of approach in the Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS).”\\nReducing dependence on the oil industry, thereby protecting consumers from its associated supply and cost volatility: The LCFS has displaced more than 30 billion gallons of petroleum fuel.\\nThe LCFS sends long-term market signals to phase out combustion fuels and increase zero emission fuels and transportation options. The LCFS updates adopted by the Board were developed after a rigorous, years-long public rulemaking process that incorporated feedback received from interested parties. Updates include:\\nProviding billions of additional dollars to fund zero-emission vehicle charging and hydrogen fueling infrastructure, including new crediting opportunities for medium - and heavy-duty refueling infrastructure, to support implementation of California’s zero emission vehicle regulations.\\nIncreasing incentives for infrastructure in low-income neighborhoods and remote locations and ensuring that historically underserved communities receive needed investment to reduce emissions and provide equitable access to a clean air future.\\nPhasing out avoided methane crediting associated with the use of biomethane used as a combustion fuel, but extending the use of biomethane for renewable hydrogen to align with goals outlined in the 2022 Scoping Plan – the state’s plan for reducing climate-warming emissions and reaching carbon neutrality.\\nUpdated guardrails\\nThe LCFS updates also include new guardrails to avoid land use changes resulting in potential loss of food production or deforestation. The majority of biomass-based diesel and sustainable aviation fuel in the LCFS has historically come from waste feedstocks, such as used cooking oil, animal fat and inedible distiller’s corn oil. To minimize potential land use issues, the program will require fuel producers track crop-based and forestry-based feedstocks to their point of origin. The LCFS will also require independent feedstock certification to ensure biomass-based diesel and sustainable aviation fuel feedstocks are not undermining natural carbon stocks. Palm-derived fuels are also explicitly prohibited from receiving credits.\\nCalifornians will benefit from these program updates in numerous ways, including:\\nAs consumers increase their use of low carbon intensity fuels and more efficient vehicles, fuel costs per mile will be reduced by 42 percent - translating to savings of over $20 billion in fuel expenditures every year by 2045. For light-duty vehicles (cars, pickup trucks, sport utility vehicles, vans, and minivans) these fuel cost savings will be even more pronounced, cutting today’s costs to Californians by more than 50 percent.\\nThe amount of LCFS proceeds invested in disadvantaged communities for clean fuel and transportation projects is estimated to be approximately $4.8 billion in the next decade.\\nCalifornians are expected to save almost $5 billion in health care costs by avoiding the impacts of air pollution.\\nThe amendments will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 558 million metric tons, NOx by more than 25,500 tons and PM 2.5 by more than 4,200 tons between 2025 and 2045.'},\n",

It is made from renewable biomass and/or waste. The agreement accelerates solutions to California’s climate and air quality goals by partnering with the aviation industry in emissions reduction efforts, and it supports a commitment by the major U.S. airlines to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, which will require completely transitioning from conventional petroleum-based jet fuel to sustainable alternatives.\\nThis collaboration is an example of California’s partnerships with industry to move toward a clean air future, and one that was made possible by the development of alternative fuels spurred by the state’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard program that provide the industry lower-carbon, sustainable options.\\n“California and the aviation industry are joining forces to tackle emissions head-on,” said Governor Gavin Newsom. “We’ve put the tools in place to incentivize cleaner fuels and spur innovation, creating opportunities like this to radically change how Californians can travel cleaner. This is a major step forward in our work to cut pollution, protect our communities, and build a future of cleaner air and innovative climate solutions.”\\n“California is once again demonstrating that smart climate action is good for the environment and good for business,” said CARB Chair Liane Randolph. “This partnership with the nation’s leading airlines brings the aviation industry onboard to advance a clean air future and will help accelerate development of sustainable fuel options and promote cleaner air travel within the state.”\\n\"A4A is pleased to launch a partnership with CARB focused on protecting the environment, reducing emissions, and increasing the use of SAF in California and across the country,” said Kevin Welsh, Vice President of Environmental Affairs and Chief Sustainability Officer at Airlines for America. “This partnership reflects the type of collaboration between government and the private sector that is necessary to achieve ambitious climate goals, and the agreement announced today reflects the strength of our commitment to a cleaner, more sustainable future for air travel. We\\'re excited to work with CARB and other SAF stakeholders to further our industry\\'s efforts to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.\"\\nA4A’s members include Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, Atlas Air Worldwide, Delta Air Lines, FedEx, Hawaiian Airlines, jetBlue Airways, Southwest Airlines, United Airlines, UPS, and associate member Air Canada. Key goals of the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Partnership include:\\nCARB and A4A will work together with sustainable aviation fuel producers, aviation stakeholders, and the federal government to ensure that at least 200 million gallons of cost-competitive options are available for use by airlines within California by 2035.\\nTo achieve these goals, CARB and A4A will work together to identify, evaluate, and prioritize new policies and actions, including incentives for investment and timely permitting to help accelerate the availability and use of sustainable aviation fuels for intrastate flights in California.\\nThe partnership will establish a Sustainable Aviation Fuel Working Group of government and industry stakeholders that will meet annually to report progress and address barriers to meeting these goals.\\nCARB staff will create a public website that will display the latest information on the availability and use of conventional jet fuel and sustainable aviation fuel within California, as well as details on relevant state and federal incentives and policies.\\nIn addition to bolstering climate action in California, this agreement supports and builds on the climate goals outlined in the federal government’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge, a national initiative to develop a comprehensive strategy for scaling up new technologies to produce sustainable aviation fuels on a commercial scale.\\nRead the agreement\\nBelow are quotes from A4A member airlines regarding the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Partnership:\\n\"Delta is appreciative for the partnership and work CARB and Airlines for America are doing to accelerate the transition to SAF.

The new language maintained a proposal to make the program's annual targets 9pc tougher in 2025 and to achieve by 2030 a 30pc reduction from 2010 transportation fuel carbon intensity levels.\\nCARB staff's latest proposals, published a little before midnight ET on 1 October, offer comparatively minor adjustments to the shock August revisions that spurred a nearly $20 after-hours rally in LCFS prompt prices. Prompt credits early in Wednesday's session traded higher by $3 than they closed the previous trading day.\\nLCFS programs require yearly reductions in transportation fuel carbon intensity. Higher-carbon fuels that exceed these annual limits incur deficits that suppliers must offset with credits generated from the distribution to the market of approved, lower-carbon alternatives.\\nCalifornia's program has helped spur a rush of new US renewable diesel production capacity, swamping west coast fuel markets and inundating the state's LCFS program with compliance credits. CARB reported more than 26mn metric tonnes of credits on hand by April this year — more than double the number of new program deficits generated in all of 2023. Staff have sought through this year's rulemaking to restore incentives to more deeply decarbonize state transportation than thought possible during revisions last made in 2019.\\nCalifornia formally began this rulemaking process in early January after publishing draft proposals in late December. Regulators initially proposed adjusting 2025 targets lower by 5pc for 2025 — a one-time decrease called a stepdown — to work toward a 30pc reduction target for 2030.\\nCARB set its sights on 21 March for adoption. But staff pulled that proposal in February as hundreds of comments in response poured in.\\nUpdated language released on 12 August proposed a steeper stepdown for 2025 of 9pc while keeping the 30pc target for 2030. The proposal also added a limit on credit generation from certain crop-based feedstocks, to 20pc of the associated volume delivered to California in certain cases.\\nRespondents generally supported the tougher targets, though fuel suppliers warned of higher prices and some credit generators argued that the state should be even more ambitious.\\nNo one praised the proposed limits on credit generation.

If approved, it will increase the degree to which fuel producers must offset their petroleum-based fuels with low-carbon alternatives. RNG groups say that will go a long way toward restoring favorable credit prices that can allow existing projects to generate revenue and support the creation of new projects at landfills, farms and elsewhere.\\n“That’s the biggest news to come out of this latest package,” Adam Schubert, a senior associate with fuels intelligence firm Stillwater Associates, said. “Credit prices ... are so low that firms can’t justify investment in the production of the low-carbon fuels that are needed for the standard to actually happen.”\\nCARB’s proposal would change the carbon intensity reduction target for 2025 from 5% to 9%. The target, which ratchets up annually, guides credit buyers to adopt a steadily increasing amount of cleaner fuels either directly or through credits.\\nThis is the second time CARB has embarked on a major amendment process for the Low Carbon Fuel Standard, which was first implemented in 2011. Since this revision process began in earnest last year, agency staff have had to field competing priorities from a range of industries, including vehicle manufacturers, fossil and alternative fuel producers, agriculture and others.\\nGroups representing renewable natural gas producers — including large landfill owners and anaerobic digestion facility developers — offered measured praise for this latest proposal.\\nIn a statement on Tuesday, American Biogas Council Executive Director Patrick Serfass said the group was appreciative of CARB’s decision to change the carbon intensity reduction target, though he noted other changes may deter investment after 2030. \\n\"This positive change will do exactly what the LCFS is designed to do: more dramatically decrease carbon emissions in California. It will also increase demand for renewable transportation fuels from biogas,\" Serfass wrote.\\nKeep up with the story. Subscribe to the Waste Dive free daily newsletter\\nSam Wade, director of public policy for the RNG Coalition, similarly issued a statement in support of the move. He has previously pushed the agency to get more aggressive in its carbon intensity reduction timeline, telling Waste Dive in May he believed the agency could have gone farther than a 9% reduction if it wished.\\nBut it’s not just industry groups jockeying for changes to the program. CARB has also faced criticism from environmental justice advocates, including its own Environmental Justice Advisory Committee. The committee has urged CARB to move the credit program away from combustion fuels more quickly by lowering the volume of incentives for fuels derived from crops like soybeans or methane derived from large-scale dairy farms.\\nBut agency staff have been reluctant to change those incentives, arguing that doing so could starve the program of renewable fuel credits that petroleum fuel producers need to buy in order to be in compliance. \\nThe update released this week offers those advocates a small victory but does not address their demands. CARB proposed setting a limit on the amount of credits that “biomass-based diesel” fuels like those produced with soybean oil can earn, essentially only crediting the fuel up to a certain point for manufacturers before cutting off the benefit.\\nThe agency also proposed to tweak avoided methane credits, a key mechanism that environmental justice groups want to see axed.\\nAvoided methane credits work by offering additional credits — that is, beyond the standard alternative fuel credits created by the program — to a fuel producer that is taking methane that would otherwise be emitted into the atmosphere and turning it into a fuel.\\nIn practice, this has meant a huge incentive for anaerobic digesters on dairy farms, which receive credits not just for producing RNG itself but also by avoiding methane emissions from dairy cow manure. Such facilities have enjoyed some of the lowest carbon intensity scores in the LCFS system and are highly attractive as credit, and therefore cash, generators.\\nCARB said it would phase out avoided methane credits for dairy farms by 2040 in a proposal from earlier this year. Environmental justice advocates condemned that decision, arguing it locks in an incentive for large, polluting farms to continue operating as normal for years.

Aviation is responsible for 11% of transportation greenhouse (GHG) emissions, making it the third largest contributor of transportation emissions. Transitioning to sustainable liquid fuels has been identified as the path with the greatest long-term opportunity to decarbonize the aviation sector.\\nSAF production is already in place and is expected to triple from 2023 levels to approximately 1.875 billion liters in 2024. Supply chains continue to mature and existing industrial infrastructure is being leveraged for SAF production. Investments in SAF have increased due to federal and state tax credits incentivizing production.\\nAlthough SAF production has increased significantly, the 2024 level will account for only 0.53% of aviation\\'s fuel requirements and 6% of renewable fuel production. There remain hurdles to the scalability and widespread adoption of SAF. SAF currently is not a one-to-one replacement or as energy dense as conventional jet fuel, and limited production capacity contributes to higher costs.\\nAs the industry continues to make headway toward a low-carbon and sustainable aviation future, continued innovation, regulatory stability, public-private partnerships, and investments are needed to help overcome the challenges and barriers to reducing the aviation sector\\'s GHG emissions.\\nWhat is sustainable aviation fuel?\\nSAF is an alternative fuel that can be produced from non-petroleum feedstocks such as used cooking oil, greases, fats, municipal solid waste, algae, agricultural and forestry waste and residues, wood mill waste, and dedicated energy crops. SAF is a \"drop-in\" fuel, meaning it can be blended with traditional fossil jet fuel at different levels depending on the feedstock and how it is produced.\\nCommitments, incentives, and programs driving aviation decarbonization\\nSeveral initiatives and commitments have placed the aviation sector at the forefront of decarbonization efforts. The Biden administration has set a goal of net-zero GHG emissions economy-wide by 2050. Additionally, through the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge launched in 2021, the US Department of Energy (DOE), the US Department of Transportation (DOT), and the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) continue to work toward reducing SAF cost, enhancing its sustainability, achieving a minimum of 50% reduction in lifecycle GHG emissions compared to conventional fuel, and expanding SAF production and use.\\nTogether, the DOE, DOT, and USDA are accelerating the research, development, demonstration, and deployment of SAF needed to scale up production to 3 billion gallons per year by 2030 and 35 billion gallons per year by 2050.\\nIn addition, members of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) committed to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. The Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA, opens new tab), a global market-based measure designed to offset international aviation emissions, encourages the use of SAF by allowing aircraft operators to reduce their offsetting requirement through the use of eligible fuels, which include CORSIA SAF.\\nThrough the Inflation Reduction Act, SAF producers are eligible for a tax credit of $1.25 per gallon of qualifying SAF that reduces GHG emissions by 50%, and an additional $0.01 per gallon for each percent the reduction exceeds 50%, up to $0.50 per gallon.\\nIn addition, several states have implemented tax credit programs that are designed to stimulate the in-state production and consumption of SAF. For example, in Minnesota, opens new tab, companies that produce or blend SAF sold between June 30, 2024, and July 1, 2030, can qualify for a tax credit of $1.50 per gallon.\\nTo qualify, the SAF must (1) be derived from biomass and not from palm fatty acid distillates, (2) reduce at least 50% lifecycle GHG emissions, (3) be produced in Minnesota or blended with aviation, gasoline, or jet fuel in Minnesota, and (4) be sold in Minnesota to a purchaser who certifies that the SAF is for use as fuel in an aircraft departing from an airport in Minnesota.\\nIn addition to these tax incentives, several states have established low carbon fuel programs that issue credits in support of low carbon fuel production. For example, California established the Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS, opens new tab) to decrease the carbon intensity of California\\'s transportation fuel pool and encourage low carbon fuel production. Providers of transportation fuels must demonstrate that the mix of fuels they offer in California meet the LCFS carbon intensity standards or benchmarks for each annual compliance period, or purchase credits to meet the standards.\\nFuels and fuel blendstocks that have a carbon intensity higher than the benchmark generate deficits, while fuels and fuel blendstocks that have a carbon intensity below the benchmark generate c'},\n",

              "  'second_title': None,\n",
              "  'content': \"Many industries have and continue to incorporate hydrogen and fuel cell technologies as part of their decarbonization efforts, a crucial aspect of addressing climate change. New hydrogen fuel cell vehicles have been debuted, and fuel cells have been identified as a viable zero-emission replacement for heavy-duty vehicles, which account for about 25% of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the transportation sector, making them a key target for decarbonization efforts.\\nDeploying hydrogen fuel cell technologies at scale will require alignment of multiple factors, including the production, transportation, and storage of hydrogen and maintaining a reliable hydrogen supply. This alignment is essential to mitigate climate change by reducing emissions and promoting sustainability.\\nWhy hydrogen?\\nThe incorporation of hydrogen and fuel cell technologies is supported by the inherent benefits of the technology for the climate, as well as government funding, incentives, and mandates. In addition to being a zero-emission technology, hydrogen fuel cell vehicles can operate at full power without loss of voltage before refueling, withstand cold environments, and refuel quickly.\\nSubstantial government funding and incentives are available to support hydrogen infrastructure, clean hydrogen production, and fuel cell technology development, demonstration, and deployment. Most recently, the Biden administration made available $1.3 billion for electric vehicle charging and hydrogen, propane, and natural gas fueling infrastructure in urban and rural communities and along designated highways, interstates, and major roadways.\\nThis funding opportunity helps implement the National Zero-Emission Freight Corridor Strategy, which prioritizes and sequences the deployment of zero-emission medium-duty and heavy-duty vehicle charging and hydrogen fueling infrastructure in key hubs and corridors between 2024 and 2040.\\nFederal and state mandates, commitments, and strategies have prioritized decarbonization of hard-to-abate sectors, such as the transportation sector. For example, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued stronger standards to reduce GHG emissions from heavy-duty vehicles beginning in model year 2027. In addition, states such as California have mandated the transition to zero-emission vehicles. These standards and mandates are expected to accelerate the transition and adoption of zero-emission vehicles, which will be key to addressing climate change in the coming decades.\\nHydrogen production, transportation and storage\\nHydrogen can be produced in several ways and using different sources, which contribute to the environmental impact of the hydrogen produced. For example, green hydrogen is produced by electrolysis of water using renewable electricity, making it a clean and sustainable energy source. Blue hydrogen is produced from natural gas using steam methane reformation (SMR), and the carbon dioxide is captured and stored, mitigating the environmental impact of the production process. On the other hand, grey hydrogen is produced through the same process, but the carbon dioxide is not captured.\\nGenerally, the lower the environmental impact of the hydrogen, the more expensive it is to produce. However, federal tax incentives, such as the hydrogen production tax credit under Section 45V of the Internal Revenue Code and the investment tax credit under Section 48, and credits available at the state level, such as the California Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) credits, can help reduce the overall cost.\\nAnother benefit of hydrogen is that it can be produced at a location relatively close to the point of consumption, though some form of transportation to the end user is often required. Pipelines are one option, but existing pipeline infrastructure is largely concentrated in the Gulf Coast and California. Hydrogen can also be transported in compressed form by truck, ship, or barge, but this can be costly.\\nHowever, the expansion of hydrogen infrastructure needed for nationwide transportation and distribution is underway through efforts such as the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs Program and fueling infrastructure funding opportunities.\\nThere are also storage considerations for hydrogen. Storing it as a gas requires high-pressure tanks, while storing it as a liquid requires well-insulated cryogenic storage vessels. Whether hydrogen can be stored onsite depends on several factors, including whether the site can accommodate the equipment needed to store hydrogen. DOE has made available funding to support the research, development, and demonstration of hydrogen storage vessels, hydrogen fueling and transfer components.\\nImportance of affordable and reliable hydrogen supply\\nMaintaining an affordable and reliable supply of hydrogen remains one of the most significant issues facing the use of hydrogen and the adoption of fuel cell technologies in decarbonization efforts. The availability, accessibility\"},\n",

The fuel has also been promoted as a way to cut emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx), a harmful pollutant that contributes to ozone deterioration and causes respiratory problems.\\nHowever, engines made more recently emit more NOx when running on renewable diesel when blended with 35% biodiesel or more, compared with conventional diesel, according to a study released by California Air Resources Board (CARB) in November.\\nCARB found in these new technology diesel engines, or NTDEs, running on 100% renewable diesel, NOx emissions increases were not statistically significant compared with CARB diesel,\\nThat could affect the way regulators revise the LCFS, which spurred investment in renewable diesel, made from fats and vegetable oils.\\nState regulators are considering changes to the LCFS that align with a 2022 update on how to bring the state to carbon neutrality by 2045. The study means regulators could have to consider whether renewable diesel increases emissions in areas with worse air quality.\\nCARB said it has \"identified several questions about the study results\" that require further evaluation, and will be accepting public comment on the study until the end of January.\\nRegulators did not respond to a request for comment.\\nHeavy-duty vehicles are one of the largest contributors to NOx emissions - a precursor of ozone and particulate matter formation. Improved emissions control technology has helped NOx emissions fall by 60% between 1990 and 2019 nationwide, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\\nCompanies and regulators had previously purported that renewable diesel reduced NOx emissions by 10%, citing the results of earlier studies that examined the fuel\\'s performance in older engines.\\nBut trucks with newer engines that ran renewable diesel did not meaningfully lower NOx emissions, according to the study. While these NTDEs are present in only 43% of the state’s commercial vehicle registrations, they account for more than 75% of the miles traveled among the state\\'s heavy-duty fleet.\\n“CARB threw caution to the wind and opened the door to renewable diesel\\'s unlimited use without having properly studied NOx emissions impact in NTDEs,” said Pat McDuff, chief executive officer at Glendale-based California Fueling, in a public comment submitted in January.\\nHe urged California regulators to reverse regulatory changes that prohibit his company from selling fuel additives meant to decrease NOx emissions in biodiesel.\\nThe state is trying to bring 19 regions into compliance with air quality standards enacted in 2015. In two regions - the south coast and the San Joaquin Valley Air Basin - CARB has targeted lowering NOx emissions as one way of improving air quality. In 2020 regulators adopted a new regulation to reduce NOx emissions 90% by 2027.\\nRenewable diesel generally cuts greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants, said Tristan Brown, associate professor of energy resource economics at SUNY and advisor on New York\\'s Climate Action Council.\\nBrown noted most biodiesel blending in the United States is 20% or less. \"The real question is what amount of NOx is emitted by NTDE engines at volumes of 10% and 20% biodiesel blend levels, and that is not reported by the study,\" Brown said.'},\n",

The U.S. Energy Department projects renewable diesel will be about 7% of the overall diesel pool by 2030; it is currently just 5%.\\nHowever, the price of LCFS credits in California, which are generated and traded by companies that produce fuel at a lower carbon intensity than a benchmark set by various states, has fallen nearly 30% in the last two months to below $145 per metric ton of carbon, according to California\\'s Air Resources Board (CARB).\\nThat is the result of rising renewable diesel sales as refiners plan to boost output of the fuel, according to industry experts.

California has created one of the biggest regional carbon markets for the transportation sector, which state regulators say is one of the most effective ways of reducing carbon emissions from road fuel.\\nIn 2020, CARB said LCFS credit generation met nearly all of the state\\'s target reduction for carbon emissions. The LCFS sets annual carbon intensity (CI) standards, or benchmarks, which become more stringent over time.\\nBut other states have struggled to coordinate with each other to introduce their own low carbon programs, which would open up additional markets for the growing supply of renewable energy and raise credit prices again.\\nLast month, an East Coast low-carbon program five years in the making that would have included Massachusetts and Connecticut died after various governors expressed concern that the program would raise gasoline prices. California currently has the highest gasoline prices in the nation at $4.70 a gallon.\\nThe program would have required large gasoline and diesel suppliers to purchase auctionable “allowances” for the pollution caused by combustion of fuels sold in participating areas.\\nGasoline-related trade groups opposed the idea, saying it would harm, rather than promote, use of fuels that produce fewer pollutants by failing to effectively encourage investment in alternative fuels.\\nStakeholders are now eying New York, which may adopt a policy backed by the New York Climate Action Council that would call for significantly increased investment in renewable diesel through 2030.\\n\"The replacement of diesel with renewable diesel and green hydrogen will reduce harmful fine particulate matter emissions in disadvantaged communities,\" the council said in a draft plan released in October.'},\n",

              "  'content': 'AT A GLANCE\\n• Palm oil and soybean oil have long been used in cooking, but their growing use as a biofuel is causing a spike in demand\\n• Ukraine’s reduced exports of sunflower oil are creating an additional surge in demand for other edible oils\\nEdible oil prices have hit record highs this year driven by strong demand. The diversification of the use of edible oils into a biofuel has led to the commodity becoming an increasingly important part of the agriculture complex.\\nPalm oil is the most commonly produced edible oil, followed by soybean oil, with rapeseed oil and sunflower oil accounting for a smaller share of the market. Production of palm oil is highly concentrated, with 85% of the world’s supply coming from Indonesia and Malaysia. Meanwhile, soybeans, from which soybean oil is extracted, are largely grown in North and South America.\\nGrowing Demand, Constrained Supply\\nWhile edible oils have long been used in cooking and as a food ingredient in varied food formulations, it is their growing use as biofuel that is behind the recent spike in demand. As governments around the world introduce mandates stipulating that a certain percentage of fuel must come from renewable sources, such as California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard, demand for biofuel has soared. Given the massive size of the energy landscape, combined with many countries setting net zero carbon targets, there is potential for demand in this area to grow significantly in the years ahead. In fact, the market for edible oils is expected to grow at a compound rate of 7.6% between now and 2029.\\nIn the past, supply has largely been able to meet demand. Soybeans compete with corn in terms of agricultural acreage. As a result, when high demand leads to elevated soybean prices, farmers traditionally switch from growing corn to soybeans, enabling this demand to be met and prices to stabilize.\\nBut supply of palm and soybean oil has not been able to keep pace with the rising demand caused by the growing use of both oils for biofuel. The trees from which palm oil is extracted take time to grow, while there has also not been a significant increase in agricultural land given over to soybean production. As a result of this mismatch between supply and demand, prices have risen. At the same time, the steep increase in energy prices has put further upward pressure on edible oils, due to their use as a biofuel.\\nOver the shorter term, the war in Ukraine has further stoked edible oil prices. Russia and Ukraine account for nearly 80% of global sunflower oil exports, but exports have been hit by sanctions on Russia and Ukrainian ports being closed. Edible oils tend to be interchangeable, so countries which were previously major consumers of sunflower oil, have switched to palm oil and soybean oil, creating an additional surge in demand. Meanwhile, labor disruption caused by Covid-19 in Malaysia has hit production and put further pressure on prices.\\nPalm Oil Soars on Export Ban\\nPalm oil prices soared to a record high earlier this year and have experienced a strong upward trajectory since May 2020. In addition to the factors discussed above, the spike was driven by political developments in Indonesia, which is the world’s largest palm oil producer. In February, the Indonesian government implemented the Domestic Market Obligation, under which producers had to set aside 20% of their shipments for local buyers. This was followed by an export ban in late April. Although the ban was lifted three weeks later, it created significant uncertainty in the market, as Indonesia accounts for 60% of global supply. This disruption to supply pushed palm oil prices up to their new record high.\\nBiofuel Demand for Soybean Oil share\\nSoybean oil prices also hit a record high earlier this year. Prices started to increase dramatically at the start of 2021 driven by the combination of the California mandate on biofuel, as well as bad weather scares during the soybean growing season. Soybeans produce both oil and meal, with the price of the two determining, and in turn, being determined by the price of soybeans. Traditionally, meal has been the more valuable of the two components, but the rise in demand for biofuel has increased the value of the oil share, with soybean oil briefly worth more than soybean meal earlier this year.\\nMeanwhile, high wheat prices as a result of the war in Ukraine, have driven the price of corn higher. As a result, some farmers have opted to continue to plant corn, rather than soybeans, suggesting supply will remain tight and prices high.\\nManaging Price Risk\\nThe recent price rises have led to significant fluctuations between the soybean oil and palm oil spread. Soybean oil and palm oil are considered “substitute goods” because they can often be used interchangeably. Even so, in the past soybean oil has traded at a premium in the $100 to $150 per metric ton range over palm oil. The steep increase in soybean oil’s price saw this premium soar to $500 per metric ton i'},\n",

That policy, which now mandates billions of gallons of ethanol and other biofuels be blended into the nation’s fuel pool, also requires a reduction in carbon intensity compared to petroleum-based fuels.\\nHANDFUL OF PROJECTS\\nEthanol groups say that their supply chain, which already produces and transports huge volumes of ethanol per year, thanks to the RFS, would be readily available to help boost production of SAF to meet the administration\\'s goals.\\nBut so far, only a handful of ethanol-to-SAF projects have been proposed.\\nLanzaJet, for example, is building in Georgia an alcohol-to-jet production facility using ethanol as a feedstock which is due to be completed in 2023, and which the company says would be the world\\'s first facility of its kind.\\nThe project would produce 10 million gallons of SAF and renewable diesel per year – a tiny fraction of the roughly 24.7 billion gallons of petroleum-based jet fuel now produced in the U.S. annually.\\nGevo has said it expects to develop, own, and operate ethanol-to-jet plants to produce SAF. The company has agreements with Delta Air Lines and American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O), opens new tab to supply each with tens of millions of gallons of SAF per year for several years starting in 2026.\\nEngineering and aerospace giant Honeywell International Inc (HON.O), opens new tab has also announced a new ethanol-to-jet fuel processing technology.'},\n",

Because Siemens (henceforth referred to as the Technology Owner) has developed, tested, and piloted a proprietary post-combustion CO2-capture technology (PostCapTM) for the removal of CO2 from the flue gas of coal- and gas-fired power plants suitable for the project, both parties decided to cooperate in executing a front-end engineering and design (FEED) study. The technology is based on an aqueous amino-acid-salt solution.\\nThe Technology Owner and Masdar have completed a FEED study for capturing 1,800,000 tons of CO2 annually from a natural-gas-fired power plant in Abu Dhabi by application of the PostCapTM technology.\\nVarious opportunities and challenges were encountered during the design of the retrofit capture plant. Challenges were often specific to the region, including local climate, water availability, and flue-gas quality. Design and optimization of the plant were influenced by local energy and labor prices. Further opportunities included integration with the power plant and with a local industrial facility. The power plant had to supply the capture plant with steam and power without reducing the original electricity-production capacity. To accomplish this, several heat- and power-integration concepts were evaluated with respect to their feasibility, including the application of a backpressure steam turbine and the retrofit of a simple-cycle gas turbine to combined-cycle gas turbine.\\nVarious cooling options were considered in view of climate and resource challenges. Cooling water had to be extracted from a re-flux stream produced by an adjacent industrial facility.\\nDrawing on the results of the FEED study, this paper presents the manner in which PostCapTM technology can be applied for capturing CO2 at a power plant in Abu Dhabi for the purpose of EOR, while satisfying specific local needs, and the way utility supply and power plant integration can be facilitated.'},\n",

Chances are your child in elementary school has also heard about it. It has been center stage in all local, national, and international political and environmental debates. I am not going to talk about it here. What I am going to articulate here is what we can do about it in our own way. By “we,” I mean we as individuals, we as SPE members, and we as oil and gas industry professionals.\\nFirst, the bad news: Indeed, there are a lot of challenges with CO2. It is a stable compound and does not readily disintegrate. The biggest challenge perhaps is the cost of capturing CO2. Most of the anthropogenic CO2 is available from fixed sources such as power plants. The CO2 first has to be separated from nitrogen, then compressed, and finally piped and pumped into a subterranean reservoir for oil recovery or storage. All of these steps are expensive.\\nNow the good news: It can be done. And we, as petroleum engineers and Earth scientists, are best suited to do it. We know our reservoirs, we have produced from them, and we can ensure that CO2 can be sent back safely and securely into them. Supercritical CO2 is an excellent solvent, especially for lighter crude oils. If it were free, or as low in cost as water, we would be injecting CO2 instead of water for its favorable properties.\\nSo how can we help? There are many areas and applications of CO2 in the oil and gas industry. CO2 enhanced oil recovery (EOR) is the bedrock and the mainstay in our application portfolio. A lot has been published in that area. At present, there remain several challenges with CO2 EOR. These include gravity override, poor sweep efficiency, and economic factors. Considerable work and research are ongoing to address all of these challenges. The papers that follow address some of them: an example of chemical-looping emerging technology in a bid to reduce CO2-capture costs; CO2 foams for improved oil recovery; commercial-scale demonstration projects; and use of CO2 in tight gas and unconventional resources.'},\n",

With extensive research linking GHG concentrations in the atmosphere to observed changes in global temperature patterns, CCS technology could play an important role in policy efforts to limit the global average temperature rise.\\nEven with the wealth of experience already in place within the oil and gas industry, the obstacles to advancing CCS to the forefront of GHG mitigation technologies remain significant. Large-scale CO2 injection projects remain primarily in the realm of commercial CO2-EOR (enhanced oil recovery) projects. The key challenges to enabling CCS include cost-effective capture and transport of industrial CO2, clear access to pore space for CO2 storage in geologic formations, proven methodologies for demonstrating storage integrity, and dissemination of best practices. SPE members can play a significant role in addressing these challenges.\\nCost-Effective Capture of Power Sector and Industrial CO2\\nA major technical challenge facing capture at electric generating facilities is that the CO2 concentration in large-\\xadvolume flue streams is quite low. Current removal technologies include techniques that apply amines, chilled ammonia, membranes, and ionic liquids to strip the CO2 from the flue stream. How\\xadever, these technologies were developed to handle smaller-scale operations and \\xadhigher-CO2-purity streams. When applied to large electric generating plants, process efficiency is reduced, and the energy penalty associated with the capture process drives up costs, increasing the levelized cost of electricity by 50% or more, depending on local factors. Also, to accommodate the substantial volumes of the CO2 and flue gas at full-scale industrial sources, the removal technologies require significant scale up and footprint for deployment.\\nWhile early movers are developing large-scale capture demonstrations such as SaskPower’s Boundary Dam Project, Southern Company’s Kemper Energy Facility (Fig. 1 above), and NRG’s Petro Nova Facility, we are still very early on the “learning curve.” Support for more development of next-generation capture technologies and large demonstrations is required to push us down the cost curve. This involves reducing the cost of materials and construction, parasitic costs related to energy for operations, compression, and operation and maintenance costs.\\nGovernment Oversight Challenges\\nMany of the aspects of a CO2 storage project mirror those of CO2-EOR projects. The land department is in charge of securing the acreage position, geoscientists describe the reservoir and seal, and engineers design the surface and subsurface equipment as well as provide a plan to maximize the value proposition offered across the acreage. In addition, some type of unitization may be required of disparate mineral and pore space owners. Finally, there is typically a state or federal permitting or oversight agency to ensure the project complies with established environmental requirements.\\nHowever, CO2 storage is currently viewed as a “waste management” activity, with perhaps little public buy-in or perceived economic benefit to the local population, particularly in areas with little to no hydrocarbon extraction industry presence. In the US, this is further exacerbated by the fact that ownership of pore space in which storage would occur is generally retained by the surface owner and the hydrocarbons are maintained by the mineral owner/lessee, and multiple owners/lessees may be involved. A well-conceived outreach strategy combined with mechanisms for ensuring both local benefits and trustworthy environmental stewardship are required to obtain local public and stakeholder acceptance of the storage projects.\\nBecause of this disparate ownership, an alternative option to ameliorate pore-space access issues is to consider offshore storage using existing or new platforms. While the offshore drilling and operations cost is considerably higher, the government commonly holds the pore and mineral rights, diminishing the number of stakeholders potentially involved.\\nSafe, Secure, Large-Scale CO2 Storage\\nA major difference between CO2 injection and hydrocarbon production is the fact that injected CO2 has to be accommodated in the subsurface by compression into the formation and pore water, increasing reservoir pressure. Determining the reservoir continuity at distance without drilling many costly appraisal wells and the resultant pressure accommodated storage capacity is a saline formation challenge. In addition, CO2 has a much higher mobility than water, and with a lower density shows strong gravity segregation. Plume modeling strategies, coupled with advanced geophysical techniques for calibration, are an area of continuing focus, particularly where laterally extensive CO2 plumes develop. Once the primary pressure accommodation space has been used, the challenge may be to develop reservoir engineering strategies to use the remaining pore space more efficiently for storage. Extraction of brine could increase storage efficiency and reduce the area affected by a pressure plume.\\nDepleted Fields and Existing Infrastructure\\nDepleted oil and gas fields offer proven secure storage—the capacity is well understood and the storage security is proven. However, they introduce some challenges. When a gas field is highly depleted, the CO2 will initially be in the gas phase, yet it is transported in the dense phase. There are a number of potential solutions that include heating, starting in gas phase, or introducing methane or nitrogen. Management of the movement of the fluid through the phase envelope is therefore key, and requires the exploitation of CO2-EOR expertise coupled with potentially novel petroleum engineering solutions. The assessment, monitoring, and repair of legacy wells is also important when dealing with depleted fields.\\nDemonstrating Secure Storage\\nScaling up CO2 storage technology to address climate change, while demonstrating to stakeholders that the process is safe and secure, is a significant challenge. The 40-plus years of experience gained in the design and operation of CO2-EOR projects provides the primary foundation for establishing a com\\xadparable understanding for the issues associated with CO2 storage. CCS-\\xadspecific monitoring, permitting, and long-term care programs must be \\xadestablished and applied to develop commercial sites. Risk assessment is an essential activity during the selection and qualification of sites for long-term storage of CO2, for the development of a risk management strategy, and in establishing guidelines for safe and effective operations. While geologic uncertainties/risks are highly site-specific, the main perceived risks are of potential CO2 or brine leakage from wells and \\xadgeologic pathways, and induced seismicity and  ground displacement.\\nWorldwide, a considerable amount of CCS regulatory framework development has occurred. In most cases, these efforts build upon existing frameworks for regulating oil and gas activities. For example, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has published underground injection control well requirements for the geologic storage of CO2, based on protection of underground drinking water sources, and has established reporting requirements under its Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program for facilities that inject CO2 underground for both CO2-EOR and geologic storage. Importantly, EPA guidance confirms that CO2-EOR can result in stored CO2. Nonetheless, substantial legal and regulatory concerns remain.\\nDealing With Abundant CO2\\nShould CO2 capture become cost-effective, the volume of CO2 available for transportation and injection would require significant expansion of the current infrastructure. Today, 50 individual CO2 pipelines with a combined length of more than 7,250 km (4,500 miles) exist in the United States. Should 10% of total emissions be captured, it would far exceed the transport ability of this infrastructure. To bridge this gap, considerable infrastructure development is needed. Early delivery targets for CO2 would include areas where well infrastructure is already in place, such as large oil fields, while areas with minimal oil and gas development would be developed later for CO2 storage. While the capabilities exist to build the infrastructure, the task will require a tremendous influx of capital and personnel, and regulatory cooperation.\\nLarge volumes of low-cost, readily available CO2 could allow for the development of new EOR strategies, using CO2 in excess of traditional practice. These techniques could include vertical or gravity-stable flooding protocols that may effectively recover the bulk of the remaining oil, while also using less water. Also, larger hydrocarbon pore volume injections in traditional horizontal floods, and possibly earlier application of CO2-EOR, might be adopted in lieu of waterflooding. New best practices for these cases would need to be developed and shared within the industry.\\nDevelopment and Dissemination of Best Practices\\nThe need for timely dissemination of CO2 storage projects best practices is key to the widespread deployment of the technology. While CO2-EOR serves as an analogue for CO2 storage, and many best practices are transferable, notable differences exist. These include regulations and regulatory entities, ownership issues, short- and long-term liability, public outreach and pressure/plume management. We believe that SPE has a role to play in the documentation and dissemination of CO2 storage best practices through support of publications and conferences/forums.'},\n",

His remarks were notable in part because they come as ExxonMobil faces accusations that it has historically downplayed its knowledge of the risks associated with climate change. \\nSeveral company projects were listed during the speech, ones that Woods emphasized are aimed at reducing emissions and increasing energy efficiency such as making biofuels from agricultural waste and algae. He also noted that ExxonMobil has a stake in about 25% of the world’s carbon-capture-and-sequestration capacity and that the company plans to invest more in this area.\\nLast year, the company also announced that it has partnered with technology developers to find out whether carbon fuel cells can be used to efficiently capture carbon dioxide on a large scale. Woods said that if this project can be used to capture emissions from power plants then it may bring about “a future in which hydrocarbon use and decarbonization go hand in hand.”\\nWhen it comes to the role of governments in such carbon-reducing innovation, Woods was cautious. He said governments can help drive innovation by opening up trade channels and creating transparent carbon pricing structures—something that ExxonMobil has supported in the past—but he knocked down mandates and subsidies for renewable energies, saying they “only hinder progress.”\"},\n",

The important question is how we can keep up with the many new and unique challenges posed by this fast-paced change.\\nThe oil and gas industry faces a very challenging future. Energy demand continues to grow, while our mature fields are declining.

Our task is to extend the life of the industry by improving the success of finding new discoveries in frontier and remote basins, increasing the ultimate recovery from existing fields, as well as the need to find ways to tap into unconventional resources. At the same time, we must intensify our focus on sustainability, which calls for meeting humanity’s needs without harming future generations.

              "  'second_title': None,\n",
              "  'content': 'To achieve goals for climate and economic growth, negative-emissions technologies (NETs) that remove and sequester carbon dioxide from the air will need to play a significant role in mitigating climate change, says a new report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. The report calls for the launch of a substantial research initiative to advance these technologies as soon as possible. Although climate mitigation remains the motivation for global investments in NETs, the committee that carried out the study and wrote the report determined that advances in NETs also could have economic rewards, as intellectual property rights and economic benefits likely will accrue to the nations that develop the best technology.\\n“Negative emissions technologies are essential to offset carbon dioxide emissions that would be difficult to eliminate and should be viewed as a component of the climate change mitigation portfolio,” said Stephen Pacala, the Frederick D. Petrie Professor in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Princeton University and chairman of the committee. “Most climate mitigation efforts are intended to decrease the rate at which people add carbon from fossil fuel reservoirs to the atmosphere. We focused on the reverse—technologies that take carbon out of the air and put it back into ecosystems and the land. We determined that a substantial research initiative should be launched to advance these promising technologies as soon as possible.”\\nUnlike carbon capture and storage technologies that remove carbon dioxide emissions directly from large point sources such as coal power plants, NETs remove carbon dioxide (the most important greenhouse gas that causes climate change) directly from the atmosphere or enhance natural carbon sinks. Storing the carbon dioxide from NETs has the same impact on the atmosphere and climate as simultaneously preventing an equal amount of carbon dioxide from being emitted. For example, combustion of a gallon of gasoline releases approximately 10 kg of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Capturing 10 kg of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and permanently sequestering it using a NET has the same effect on atmospheric carbon dioxide as any mitigation method that simultaneously prevents a gallon of gasoline combustion. \\nThe committee concluded that the NETs available today could be safely scaled up to capture and store a significant fraction of the total emissions both in the US and globally but not enough to keep total global warming below 2°C, the target of the Paris agreement. Therefore, a concerted research effort is needed to address the constraints that currently limit deployment of NETs, such as high costs, land and environmental constraints, and energy requirements.   \\nFour land-based negative emissions technologies are ready for large-scale deployment at costs competitive with emissions mitigation strategies, the report says. These technologies include reforestation, changes in forest management, and changes in agricultural practices that enhance soil carbon storage. The fourth NET ready for scale up is bioenergy with carbon capture and sequestration—in which plants or plant-based materials are used to produce electricity, liquid fuels, or heat and any carbon dioxide that is produced is captured and sequestered.\\nHowever, these four NETs cannot yet provide enough carbon removal at reasonable cost without substantial unintended harm, the report says. Repurposing a significant amount of current agricultural land for growing new forests or feedstocks for bioenergy with carbon capture and sequestration could have significant effects on food availability. Repurposing tropical forest would harm biodiversity. Research could identify ways to soften the land constraint, for instance, by developing crop plants that take up and sequester carbon more efficiently in soils or by reducing food waste or demand for meat. \\nTwo other negative emissions technologies could be revolutionary, the committee said, because they have high potential capacity to remove carbon. Direct air capture uses chemical processes to capture carbon dioxide from the air, concentrate it, and inject it into a storage reservoir. However, it is currently limited by high cost. There is no commercial driving force for developing direct air capture technologies; therefore, developing a low-cost option will require sustained government investment. Carbon mineralization—which essentially accelerates weathering so carbon dioxide from the atmosphere forms a chemical bond with reactive minerals—is currently limited by lack of fundamental understanding.

In steady-state operations, Gorgon is expected to have the lowest greenhouse-gas-emissions intensity of any LNG project in Australia, Chevron said.\\nGorgon is one of the world's largest LNG projects, with a three-train, 15.6-mpta LNG facility. The project develops the offshore Gorgon and Jansz-Io fields. Gorgon gas contains 14% naturally occurring reservoir carbon dioxide.\\nGas from Gorgon and Jansz-Io is transported via subsea pipeline to Barrow Island, where carbon dioxide is separated from gas during the liquefaction process. The carbon dioxide is compressed and transported via pipeline for injection into the Dupuy formation, a sandstone reservoir, which is 2.5-km deep. Chevron said injected carbon dioxide is monitored by observation wells, ongoing seismic surveys, and other technology.\\nThe Australian government has contributed $60 million toward the capital cost of the injection project as part of the country’s Low Emissions Technology Demonstration Fund.\\nThe Australian subsidiaries of Chevron operate the Gorgon Project with a 47.3% stake.

              "  'content': 'A new joint study will test the economic viability of taking CO2 from a cement plant and giving it to an oil company to pump underground.\\nOccidental Petroleum (Oxy) and Total announced this week they are leading a consortium to assess the viability of a commercial-scale carbon-capture facility built specifically for cement operations.\\nThe joint study will evaluate the cost of a facility capable of capturing 725,000 tonnes of CO2 per year from a cement plan in Florence, Colorado. Emissions from the plant, owned by the Swiss multinational company LafargeHolcim, are to be sequestered underground by Oxy. This implies that the Houston-based operator may use the CO2 for its expansive enhanced oil recovery (EOR) projects in Texas.\\nRounding out the consortium is Svante, developer of the carbon sequestration technology that will be put to use in the pilot. Founded in 2007 and based in the Vancouver area, Svante says its process can “catch and release” CO2 from a flue gas stream within 60 seconds.\\nA key enabler is the firm’s solid adsorbent nanomaterial, which allows it to maintain a smaller inventory of material compared with traditional liquid solvents that are commonly used for CO2 scrubbing. A sugar-cube sized amount of the solid nanomaterial has the equivalent surface area of a football field.\\nThe agreement to launch the study is the latest in a string of oil and gas investments made in the area of carbon capture, use, and storage (CCUS). Oxy is participating in the project through its Oxy Low Carbon Ventures group that was formed to help the company expand its core business of hydrocarbon extraction while lowering or offsetting its overall greenhouse gas emissions.\\nTotal said it plans to spend 10% of its annual research and development budget this year on CCUS technology, which it considers essential to curbing worldwide emissions.\\nIn addition to this project, Oxy is funding other low-carbon technologies including a newly opened solar facility. Oxy is working with Canadian startup Carbon Engineering to construct what will be the world’s largest “direct air capture” facility in the Permian Basin. The stated goal of this project is to extract CO2 from the atmosphere and use it to support Oxy’s EOR operations.\\nTotal, Svante, and LafargeHolcim partnered last year on a similar project that seeks to capture carbon from a cement plan in British Colombia, Canada. This project is focused on re-injecting the captured CO2 into concrete.\\nSvante and Husky Energy completed a 30 ton-per-day demonstration plant last summer at the Pikes Peak South thermal project for an estimated cost of $15 million. Sanctioned in 2012, the project seeks to reduce the carbon intensity of heavy oil extraction and has the potential to expand to cover more of the area’s operations, which support a growing production base of 37,000 B/D.'},\n",

The industry’s operations account for 9% of all human-made greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions. In addition, it produces the fuels that create another 33% of global emissions.\\nSeveral trends are focusing the minds of industry executives. One is that investors are pushing companies to disclose consistent, comparable, and reliable data. Activist shareholders, for example, are challenging US- and Europe-based oil majors on their climate policies and emissions-reduction plans. Investors are also increasingly conscious of environmental issues. In the five markets examined by the Global Sustainable Investment Alliance—Australia and New Zealand, Canada, Europe, Japan, and the United States—sustainable investments reached assets of $30.7 trillion in early 2018, one-third of total investment. At September’s UN climate summit, an alliance of the world’s largest pension funds and insurers (representing $2.4 trillion in assets) committed itself to transitioning its portfolios to net-zero emissions by 2050.\\nAt the same time, renewable technologies have been getting cheaper. In the United States, the cost of solar—both photovoltaics and utility scale—has fallen more than 70% since 2011, and the cost of wind by almost two-thirds. By 2025, they could be competitive with natural-gas-based power generation in many more regions.\\nOther forces are also coming into play. Although there is still no global market, carbon taxes or trading systems cover 20% of worldwide emissions, compared with 15% in 2017, according to the World Bank. Many European governments plan to implement binding GHG emissions targets and are drawing up national energy and climate plans.'},\n",

              "  'content': 'The offshore drilling contractor’s latest effort to curb emissions relies on technology developed during the US space shuttle program and could become commercial by 2022.\\nTo offset the carbon footprint of its operations in places such as offshore Malaysia and the North Sea, Denmark-based Maersk Drilling is turning to California. The offshore drilling contractor announced this week that it will invest $1 million in a company called Clean Energy Systems that is developing a new combustion technology for the industrial sector.\\nIt uses biomass fuel to produce syngas from which hydrogen and methane can be separated for sales. Based in the Sacramento area, Clean Energy Systems says the hydrogen-depleted syngas can be burned to make electricity, the associated CO2 emissions of which is then fully captured and can be used for enhanced oil recovery or stored in the ground.\\nBecause the system uses biomass fuel, e.g., forestry or agricultural waste, that consumed CO2 over its organic lifetime and enables CO2 storage, the process is considered by the companies to be a net-negative emission solution. But since the technology is not designed to operate on a drilling rig, Maersk Drilling will instead seek to leverage it by generating carbon credits that will offset its emissions elsewhere.\\n“By investing in Clean Energy Systems’ concept, we are helping to bring alive a new technology which can remove CO2 from the atmosphere. We believe the world needs a broad portfolio of technologies and solutions to meet the challenge posed by climate change, and by engaging in this project, we support the development of carbon capture and storage in a way that could allow us to progress towards carbon-neutral drilling,” said Morten Kelstrup, the chief operating officer of Maersk Drilling.\\nThe emerging technology is based around the rocket engines used on the space shuttle along with other combustion technologies that produce high-energy gases. The full suite includes high-pressure, high-temperature steam-gas generators, turboexpanders, reheaters, and heat exchangers that were built using rocket-engine combustion principles.\\nClean Energy Systems said its first commercial project will begin by late 2020 and will capture and store 300,000 tons of CO2 annually.\\nIn addition to this recent investment, Maersk Drilling has joined a consortium in Denmark to advance CO2 sequestration. It also is developing the first offshore rig to operate using onshore power sources and is upgrading two jackup rigs to become hybrid units that will operate with lower emissions.'},\n",

              "  'content': 'To go big on capturing CO2, the oilfield service company is acquiring a company that specializes in going small.\\nBaker Hughes is buying a startup called Compact Carbon Capture to bolster its energy transition strategy, the company said today in an announcement.\\nBaker Hughes described carbon-capture technology as “critical” for the energy industry and that it “is among the most viable decarbonization paths” for both retrofitting existing assets and greenfield projects.”\\n“We are positioning our portfolio for new energy frontiers, and we believe there will be strong growth potential of carbon capture for both industrial applications and oil and gas projects,” Baker Hughes’ Chief Executive Officer Lorenzo Simonelli said in the statement.\\nThe Bergen-based Compact Carbon Capture is developing technology that it hopes to someday install at industrial sites around the world.\\nTrue to its name, its core product is a modular CO2-capturing system that relies on high-speed rotating solvent-based beds that rely on static-based columns to absorb the greenhouse gas. The company said that compared to the traditional technologies, its platform requires 75% less area to achieve the same throughput.\\nThe smaller footprint that this concept affords opens its potential market to crowded refineries or facilities notorious for having limited real estate, such as offshore oil and gas platforms. Outside of oil and gas, Compact Carbon Capture is targeting waste-to-energy plants and ship installations.\\nSimonelli added that Baker Hughes will incubate the technology to a point that the company can offer “one of the industry’s lowest cost-per-ton carbon-capture solutions.”\\nBaker Hughes did not disclose terms of the deal. The announcement implied that both companies are exploring synergies with Baker Hughes’ existing line of turbomachinery that was inherited from its previous owner GE.\\nCompact Carbon Capture was founded in 2018 but its roots trace back to technology patented in 1999 and a subsequent research and development project funded by Equinor in 2007. The company was also part of Spanish oil company Repsol’s technology accelerator program.'},\n",

Here’s how they can excel at both.\\nBack in the early stages of the pandemic, a high-ranking executive at GALP told me the Portuguese company was positioning itself to become “the Amazon of Energy,” explaining that a fully digitalized operation and a diverse portfolio of products and services that extend well beyond GALP’s oil and gas roots would enable the company to thrive, even in the face of extreme disruption.\\nNow, more than 2 years later, the disruption in energy markets has indeed reached extreme levels due to the war in Ukraine, inflation, economic uncertainty, changing climate, the global push to decarbonize, and yes, even the remnants of the COVID-19 pandemic. All of which is testing the ability of oil, gas, and energy companies to respond to rapidly changing market signals and energy priorities.\\nDoing business in highly volatile market conditions has long been a strong suit for hydrocarbon-focused energy companies. Now, amid a unique confluence of factors, these companies are being asked to be more responsive, agile, and Amazon-like than they have ever been, with the ability to rapidly read the signals they’re getting from the market, from geopolitical forces and other sources, then respond, reprioritize, reallocate, and scale accordingly. That could mean producing and exporting more liquefied natural gas supplies for the European market to fill the void left by Russia, for example, or accelerating timelines for renewable energy production projects to reduce reliance on coal for electricity generation.\\nHow can traditionally hydrocarbon-focused companies answer the call—and in doing so, take advantage of the opportunities that today’s unique market dynamics present? I see five keys to maintaining a high level of operational and supply chain readiness, without compromising near-term or long-term profitability.'},\n",

              "  'content': \"The latest signs that momentum is building in the geothermal space include military bases.\\nA quartet of geothermal developers made headlines this week with agreements that could lead to defense contracts, and one that received new funding.\\nThe US Department of Defense (DoD) has recently expanded its geothermal initiative with the inclusion of three new companies—Fervo Energy, GreenFire Energy, and Sage Geosystems.\\nThe initiative aims to reduce the military's carbon footprint and enhance energy self-sufficiency. Plans are underway for early-stage studies by these companies at military installations across California, Nevada, and Texas.\\nFervo Energy, which specializes in enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) utilizing modern horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing technologies, will explore the feasibility of drilling and completing EGS wells at the US Naval Air Station Fallon in Nevada.\\nThe selection follows reports earlier this year that Fervo issued government filings showing it has raised approximately $138.5 million of a targeted $221 million in equity financing. The Houston-based company recently highlighted that drilling costs at its Project Cape in Utah have dropped by nearly half, from $9.4 million to $4.8 million per well.\\nSage Geosystems is also set to conduct a feasibility study at the US Fort Bliss Army Base in Texas. Sage's approach targets shallower hot dry-rock formations than typical geothermal projects. The company secured $17 million in Series A funding this year and is collaborating with Texas electric regulators to develop a 3-MW subsurface energy storage system by year's end. This innovative system plans to use injected fluids that are stored under pressure to generate electricity on demand.\\nCalifornia-based GreenFire Energy, which develops closed-loop geothermal technology that avoids contact with subsurface water, will evaluate the deployment of its systems at the US Naval Air Facility in El Centro, California. GreenFire is supported by several investors, including Baker Hughes, which has helped test the technology at its testing facility in Oklahoma City.\\nThese companies join four others—Eavor, Teverra, Zanskar Geothermal and Minerals Inc.—previously selected by the DoD, which are now at various stages of project evaluation in Alaska, California, Idaho, and Texas.\\nIn a separate announcement, GA Drilling said this week it raised $15 million from investors following successful geothermal drilling technology tests. Key participants include existing investor global drilling rig contractor Nabors, along with several private investors. The capital injection will support GA Drilling's efforts to commercialize its AnchorBit technology, capable of reaching drilling depths of 4 to 5 km, which the firm claims will extend the current economic limits of many geothermal wells by at least 1 km.\\nGA Drilling is also in discussions to help create a 12-MW geothermal power plant in Lower Saxony, Germany. This project is so far working under a nonbinding memorandum of understanding signed in February.\"},\n",

This will drive innovation to reduce the carbon intensity of existing fuels and develop the next generation of cleaner fuels, ultimately reducing the state’s reliance on petroleum. Transportation alone accounts for 40 percent of California’s Greenhouse Gas emissions.\\n\"The Low Carbon Fuel Standard is an essential part of California’s program to move away from dirty fuels and toward a clean energy future,” according to Air Resources Board Chairman Mary D. Nichols. “These changes streamline the program. They ensure that we accurately account for every gram of carbon released during the extraction and transportation of unrefined fossil fuels, no matter where they come from.\"\\nOne key amendment will improve how the regulation accounts for the carbon intensity of crude oils. The carbon intensity of crudes can vary significantly with heavy crudes generally having a higher carbon footprint.  The proposed amendments require that the carbon intensity of crudes be fully accounted for just like other fuels under the program.  The provision also incentivizes innovation by providing credits for specific actions to reduce the carbon intensity of crude oil.\\nThe amendments also clarify which regulated parties receive low carbon fuel credits for the electricity used to charge electric vehicles.\\nFor residential charging, the electric utilities will be eligible for the credits, as they appear best suited to send the credit value back to electric vehicle owners in the form of rebates, time-of-use rates or other incentives. For public access charging, companies that install and service charging units in public settings such as malls or parking structures may receive the related credits.  Finally, businesses that install private access charging stations for employees, or fleet operators that operate at least three electric vehicles may also be eligible for credits.\\nRegulated facilities began operating under the Low Carbon Fuel Standard in April of 2010. The Air Resources Board estimates the Low Carbon Fuel Standard will achieve 15 million metric tons of greenhouse gas reduction by 2020. The standard is also expected to lead to replacement of the equivalent of up to four billion gallons of gasoline by then. The Low Carbon Fuel Standard will drive the development of new fuels to help clean California’s air and protect the state from dramatic price spikes seen with petroleum.\\nThe Low Carbon Fuel Standard is designed to work with California’s new Cap-and-Trade Program and the upcoming Advanced Clean Car regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions now, and for decades into the future. \\nAll documents related to these amendments are available at: https://www.arb.ca.gov/regact/2011/lcfs2011/lcfs2011.htm.'},\n",

These credits are roughly the same as removing 1 million cars from the roads for a year in terms of preventing greenhouse gases from entering the atmosphere. \\n“This program is succeeding: California has a thriving market for new, low-carbon fuels, there is an ample supply of low-carbon fuel credits, and the marketplace and the regulation provide businesses with the flexibility needed to comply,” said CARB Chair Mary D. Nichols. “The Low Carbon Standard is fully delivering on its promise to drive innovation and create a thriving market that delivers clean, low-carbon fuels for the trucks, buses and cars in California.”\\nThe Low Carbon Fuel Standard took effect in 2011, and is designed to lower carbon emissions generated at every stage of a fuel’s production. In California, transportation is the single largest sector for climate impact, responsible for 37 percent of the state’s total greenhouse gas emissions.  \\nThe transportation sector is also responsible for the majority of the state’s air pollution which adversely impacts public health. Thus, by encouraging the production and use of clean fuels in California the LCFS is reducing emissions of other pollutants of concern.\\nTo date renewable and low-carbon fuels rewarded under the LCFS have displaced 5.3 billion gallons of gasoline, and 1.2 billion gallons of diesel fuel. Overall, the program has generated 16.55 million credits with a current balance (that is, over-compliance) of 7.41 million credits. Each credit is the equivalent of 1 metric ton of carbon dioxide. \\nThe 2015 annual reports demonstrate exceedingly high levels of overall compliance.  Of the 52 entities who sell high carbon fuels, and have an obligation under the program, only a single company – Astra Oil Company LLC – ended the compliance period with a small shortfall of 337 credits and will be required to purchase the necessary credits from the LCFS Credit Clearance Market (CCM) between June 1 and July 31, 2016.  \\nThe CCM is a cost containment mechanism introduced into the regulation last year and allows a company to purchase credits offered for sale by producers who have generated a surplus.  Sellers in the CCM voluntarily offer them into the pool of credits to be made available to other companies that may require them for compliance purposes.  Companies that have pledged credits to the CCM in 2016 include BP Products, North America Inc.; Calgren Renewable Fuels; and Titan El Toro LLC.\\nQuarterly LCFS compliance information can be found here.\\nFull year data can be found here.'},\n",

It shows 100 percent compliance with the regulation.\\n“Full compliance is further evidence that the LCFS is working as designed,” said Executive Officer Richard Corey. “This means that cleaner, renewable fuels encouraged by the program are now replacing hundreds of millions of gallons of fossil fuel every year and significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions, as well as other pollutants.”\\nThe LCFS requires transportation fuel producers to reduce the carbon intensity of their fuels 10 percent by 2020. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are counted at all stages of production, known as “well-to-wheel” life cycle analysis.\\nThe LCFS was developed to help California achieve AB 32’s 2020 reduction target of a return to 1990 levels of GHG emissions. The program is also important for reaching the 2030 GHG reduction target set by the Governor and the Legislature. That new target requires GHG emissions 40 percent below 1990 levels. \\nThe program is providing consumers with an increasing volume of cleaner fuels. As an example, in 2016, renewable liquid fuels displaced over 400 million gallons of diesel, and more than 80 million gallons were displaced by renewable natural gas. There are 224 companies reporting in the LCFS. Of those, 54 generated credit deficits for fuels with carbon intensity above the desired baseline and were required to make up for the shortfall. All obligations were fulfilled.\\nIn 2016, the industry continued to over-comply with the regulation, generating 9.1 million credits against 6.8 million deficits. \\nSince the start of the program in 2011 it has generated credits representing 25.6 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emission reductions. That equals over-compliance of  9.7 million metric tons, and means that GHG emission reductions are occurring ahead of schedule.'},\n",

              "  'content': \"The Air Resources Board today re-adopted a Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS), which requires a 10 percent reduction by 2020 in the carbon intensity of transportation fuels. The LCFS, a pillar supporting the state’s efforts to fight climate change, delivers more clean fuels for Californians, and reduces emissions of greenhouse gases and other air pollutants.\\n“Today’s action builds on years of successful implementation and will continue reducing carbon emissions from the transportation sector. Transportation is the largest source of greenhouse gases in the state,” said Air Resources Board Chair Mary D. Nichols. “This program is a key element of California’s plans to enact Governor Brown’s Executive Order mandating a 50 percent cut in petroleum use by 2030.” \\nThe LCFS is an important tool in California’s efforts to reduce the impacts of climate change by spurring innovation in an array of cleaner fuels. The program requires that transportation fuels used in California meet a baseline target for carbon intensity. That target is reduced each year. If a product is above the annual carbon intensity target, the fuel incurs deficits. If a product is below that target, the fuel generates credits which may be used later for compliance, or sold to other producers who have deficits. So far, fuel producers are over-complying with the regulation.\\nCarbon intensity is determined through a life cycle analysis measuring the amount of carbon generated during the extraction, production, transportation, and combustion of a fuel. The LCFS does not require use of any specific fuel, only that regulated parties find a blend of fuels and credits that will meet the declining target each year.\\nThe LCFS is a pillar supporting California’s effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with AB 32’s 2020 target and to achieve further reductions beyond that.  The regulation is also intended to spur innovation in transportation fuels and to reduce California’s dependence on petroleum.\\nThe decline in the LCFS carbon intensity targets was frozen due to a legal challenge. To address the court’s ruling and to strengthen the program, the Air Resources Board readopted the LCFS regulation following public testimony delivered yesterday at the first of a two-day Board meeting. \\nThe readopted version of the LCFS includes a number of modifications developed with stakeholder input. These include:\\nIncorporating additional cost containment in response to stakeholder concerns about possible price spikes by including a mechanism to cap LCFS credit prices;\\nStreamlining the application process for alternative fuel producers seeking a carbon intensity score;\\nImproving the process for earning LCFS credits by charging electric vehicles.\\nAlternative Diesel Fuels\\nThe Board today also adopted a regulation governing alternative diesel fuels (ADF). The regulation puts in place a three-step process beginning in 2016 to create a path to bring cleaner diesel substitutes into the market. This regulation also establishes requirements and fuel specifications for biodiesel to ensure the emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) from biodiesel use will not increase, and will be reduced over time.  Biodiesel and other ADFs can help producers achieve their target under the LCFS.\\nOther programs that will result in a decreased use of petroleum while helping achieve the 40 percent reduction of greenhouse gases by 2030 as called for by Governor Brown include the advanced clean car regulations that deliver greater fuel efficiency, the zero-emission vehicle mandate putting more electric and hydrogen powered cars on the streets, and the State's efforts under SB 375 to develop more livable, walkable communities and improve public transit.\\nCalifornia’s greenhouse gas reduction programs achieve additional benefits. For example, the reduction of greenhouse gases as a result of reduced petroleum use often coincides with reductions of air pollutants that increase the severity of asthma and cardiovascular disease, and ultimately cost Californians their lives.\"},\n",

The LCFS requires that companies producing fuel for use in California lower the carbon in their production process 10 percent by 2020.\\nThe regulation requires that fuel suppliers meet, on an annual basis, a clean fuel target for the vehicle fuels they sell in California. If an individual fuel they supply is below that annual target its carbon emissions are lower and it generates marketable credits for the producer; fuels above that number generate deficits. If producers are unable to supply enough low-carbon fuels in a year to meet the annual target, they must acquire credits from other fuel suppliers in the marketplace to make up the deficit. SK Energy Americas agreed to pay the $395,000 penalty because it failed to cover its deficit in 2014.\\nAll producers are required to accurately report the types of fuel produced for sale in California and transactions for sale of that fuel. CARB took Alon and Paramount to court for their failure to accurately report its sales. Kern Oil was fined for inaccurate reporting of fuel type, and in addition to the fine CARB invalidated the credits associated with the misreported batches of fuel.\\nThe LCFS is a tool critical to achieving California’s 2020 GHG emission reduction goal of a return to 1990 levels. It will also be important in reaching the legislatively mandated 2030 reduction goal of 40 percent below 1990 levels and 2050 target of reductions 40 percent below 2030 levels.\\nCARB is amending the LCFS starting in 2021 to require fuel producers to reduce emissions an additional 20 percent by 2030. The amendments will also bring more alternative fuels, such as jet fuels, into the program, and add a third-party verification program. Another amendment will create a variety of credits and partial credits for electric vehicle electrification to promote development of electric vehicle infrastructure called for in Governor Brown’s Executive Order B-48-18'},\n",

The 2017 Compliance Report for the Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) shows 100 percent compliance with the regulation.\\n“This is great news and further evidence that California is on the right track in the fight to address climate change and ensure everyone has clean air to breathe,” said CARB Executive Officer Richard Corey. “This program gives consumers more fuel choices and is driving the development of a burgeoning clean-fuel market in California”.\\nThe program considers greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at all stages of production of a fuel, from pump or field to wheel. It was originally developed to support a return to 1990 levels of climate-changing gases by 2020, as required by AB 32, the 2006 landmark climate bill. Currently fuel producers who sell their product in California must lower the amount of overall carbon in their fuels 10 percent by 2020.\\nNow that a new climate target of a 40 percent reduction of climate-changing gases is in place for 2030, CARB staff has proposed a further reduction in the LCFS to reach a 20 percent decrease of carbon in vehicle fuels to help meet that target. That reduction will help provide the basis for another overall reduction of an additional 40 percent by 2050.\\nThe program provides consumers with an increasing volume and variety of cleaner fuels. As an example, in 2017, renewable liquid fuels displaced over 500 million gallons of diesel, and more than 100 million gallons were displaced by renewable natural gas. Electricity displaced about 75 million gallons of petroleum.\\nThe 100 percent compliance rate is further proof of the success of the program.  Of the 262 companies reporting under the program, 55 generated deficits for supplying fuels that were dirtier than the 2017 program benchmark. They were required to make up for their shortfall by purchasing credits from clean fuel providers. All other companies brought cleaner fuels to market—fuels that were below the carbon-intensity baseline.\\nSince its start in 2011 the program has generated credits representing a total reduction of 35.8 million metric tons of climate-changing gases. That equals an over-compliance of 9.8 million metric tons, meaning that that GHG emission reductions are occurring ahead of schedule. The clean fuels also reduced emissions of toxic pollutants as well as those that cause smog.\\nGoing forward, CARB staff has proposed a number of amendments to the LCFS besides the 20 percent reduction target. All the amendments are to help achieve the overall 2030 GHG reduction target of 40 percent below 1990 levels.\\nThe proposed amendments include credit generation for new innovative technologies such as hydrogen and electricity fueling stations, carbon capture and sequestration projects and cleaner alternative jet fuels. Other proposed amendments improve crediting for innovative actions at petroleum refineries, and establish an independent third-party verification and verifier accreditation system to ensure accuracy of LCFS reported data.\\nThe amendments were developed with extensive input from industry and the public.

              "  'content': 'The California Air Resources Board (CARB) today approved changes to the Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) designed to make the program a more versatile, comprehensive tool in the fight against climate change. \\nSince 2011, the LCFS has been a cornerstone of California’s effort to reduce greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions and has spurred innovation in low-carbon transportation fuels such as hydrogen, electricity and biodiesel. Last year, the LCFS resulted in more than two billion gallons of petroleum and natural gas being replaced with cleaner, renewable transportation fuels.\\nThe standard currently requires a 10 percent reduction in the “carbon intensity” of California’s transportation fuels by 2020. Carbon intensity is determined by the amount of carbon emitted throughout a fuel’s entire life cycle, from extraction or production to combustion.\\nThe amendments approved today by the Board require a 20 percent reduction in carbon intensity by 2030, the most stringent requirement in the nation. The new requirement aligns with California’s overall 2030 target of reducing climate changing emissions 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030, which was set by Senate Bill 32 and signed by Governor Brown in 2016. \\n“These amendments will take California’s climate fight up another notch,” said Board Chair Mary D. Nichols. “The addition of credits for alternative aviation fuels makes the program more flexible and adds a major source of potential greenhouse gas reductions. Using some of the credits to give a new car buyer a break on electric transportation will provide a clear incentive for zero emission vehicle sales and infrastructure, as requested by the legislature and Governor Brown.”\\nIncentives for ZEV Sales and Infrastructure\\nThe amendments incentivize development of additional zero emission vehicle infrastructure and the sale of electric and hydrogen vehicles, building on utilities ability to collect LCFS credits based on charging, and adding provisions to jump start infrastructure installation through credits generated based on the expected capacity of fast charging and hydrogen refueling stations.\\nThe LCFS program is implemented using a system of tradeable credits, each of which is equivalent to one metric ton of carbon. Credits are generated by producers of cleaner fuels and can be sold to producers whose product will not meet the program’s declining benchmark for carbon intensity. \\nIn the case of utilities, credits are generated based on charging for zero emission vehicles. Part of the proceeds from sale of those utility credits will be used to increase the rebates from utilities to drivers purchasing electric vehicles. \\nThe amendments also restructure the various utility vehicle rebate programs into a single pool so application and payment processes are uniform regardless of which utility is involved, and so the rebates can be made available through small utilities as well as large ones. \\nProtocol for Carbon Capture & Storage\\nToday’s CARB vote also puts in place the most stringent regulatory protocol in the country to set requirements for carbon capture and storage (CCS). CCS is a process that collects carbon emissions before they reach the atmosphere and injects them into permanent underground storage sites. This process should be particularly useful to ethanol producers, as it has the potential to reduce their carbon intensity by up to an additional 40 percent.\\nThe international aviation market is responsible for about two percent of the world’s GHG emissions. With today’s CARB vote, alternative, or renewable, aviation fuels may now also generate LCFS credits. Producers of those fuels will be permitted to voluntarily opt into the LCFS program.\\nThe program will also begin using CARB-trained and accredited third-party verifiers to provide additional verification of reported reductions in carbon intensity. This process will be similar to the rigorous verification standards for emission reductions in the cap-and-trade program.\\nLCFS compliance began in January of 2011. The amendments approved today follow a public process that lasted two years and included 22 workshops, multiple draft documents and numerous one-on-one stakeholder meetings.\\nThe LCFS is part of a comprehensive set of programs that California relies on to reduce carbon emissions and fight climate change. Others include cap-and-trade, the Advanced Clean Car Program, the Renewables Portfolio Standard and the Short-Lived Climate Pollutant strategy.\\nToday’s public hearing was the second hearing on these amendments, which take effect on January 1, 2019.'},\n",

The 2018 data also shows fuel producers are in 100 percent compliance with the LCFS.\\n“Renewable and bio-diesel, renewable natural gas, ethanol, and electricity are all seeing growth under the LCFS,” said CARB Executive officer Richard W. Corey. “Californians have the widest variety of cleaner low-carbon vehicles available anywhere in the country. The LCFS is catalyzing investments in these cleaner alternative fuels, providing consumers with more choices, and reducing emissions of toxic pollutants and greenhouse gases. These are key reasons why other states and nations are establishing similar programs.”\\nThe program aims to reduce the carbon intensity of transportation fuels by considering greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at all stages of production, from extraction to combustion.

California reached that overall goal in 2016.\\nNow a climate target of an additional 40 percent overall reduction of climate-changing gases is in place for 2030, under SB 32. To help California reach that goal, CARB built on the success of the LCFS by doubling the required reduction level and setting a 2030 target for vehicle fuels of 20-percent less carbon than is now found in gasoline and diesel fuel. Those cleaner fuels will displace millions more gallons of fossil fuels, helping pave the way for California to achieve full carbon neutrality by 2045.\\nThe standard provides consumers with a growing variety and volume of cleaner fuels. Renewable liquid fuels – including renewable and biodiesel – displaced over 568 million gallons of diesel in 2018. Nearly 120 million gallons of diesel were displaced by renewable natural gas, and electricity – used to run hundreds of thousands of plug-in cars and trucks – displaced about 96 million gallons of petroleum.\\nThe 100 percent compliance rate is further proof of the success of the program.

The inaccurate information spanned 24 quarterly reports. Tesoro formally acknowledged the mistake in a letter outlining the problems, and worked with CARB to account for all the fuel provided and correct their reports. Because of the company’s cooperation, the settlement is for far less than the maximum possible penalties.\\nThe money from the fine will be deposited in the state Air Pollution Control Fund where it can be appropriated by the legislature for air quality and greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction efforts.\\nThe LCFS encourages the use of cleaner, low-carbon fuels in California. It also encourages the production of those fuels, and therefore, reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.\\nThe LCFS standards are expressed in terms of the \"carbon intensity\" (CI) of gasoline and diesel fuel and their various substitutes. CI is calculated based on the \"life cycle\" greenhouse gas emissions of a fuel. Those emissions include carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen oxide and other greenhouse gas contributors. This life cycle assessment examines the greenhouse gas emissions associated with each step of the production, transportation and use of a given fuel, sometimes referred to as “well-to-wheel” analysis.\\nUnder the LCFS, fuel producers generate deficits or credits based on an annual baseline CI. Fuels with a CI above the baseline create deficits; fuels with a CI below the baseline generate credits.

Since the program launch in November 2020, more than $319 million in rewards have been received by EV buyers. Of the total rewards, 21.2% of incentives went to customers in underserved communities, 10% to customers in low-income communities and another 10% to customers in disadvantaged communities.\\n“The California Clean Fuel Reward provides an easy ‘on-the-hood’ price reduction right at the dealership that lowers the purchase price.

The LCFS is one of several programs developed under AB 32 (the 2006 Global Warming Solutions Act) to cut California’s emissions of climate warming greenhouse gas. Other programs include Cap-and-Trade, which establishes a declining limit to emissions allowed in the state by requiring industry to pay for pollution produced. Newer regulations such as Advanced Clean Trucks and Advanced Clean Fleets put in place a phased-in transition to sell and implement clean truck technology in California, in line with Governor Gavin Newsom’s Executive Order calling for all heavy duty vehicles traveling in the state to be zero emissions by 2045. In July, CARB announced the Clean Truck Partnership with the nation’s leading truck manufacturers, including the Engine and Truck Manufacturers Association and its member companies, and Ford Motor Company, that advances the development of zero-emissions truck technology, adding further momentum to the shift to cleaner transportation fuels.\\nThe LCFS program helped to replace nearly two billion gallons of regular diesel fuel in 2022 with a combination of cleaner fuels, including renewable diesel, biodiesel, electricity, and hydrogen.

It is made from renewable biomass and/or waste. The agreement accelerates solutions to California’s climate and air quality goals by partnering with the aviation industry in emissions reduction efforts, and it supports a commitment by the major U.S. airlines to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, which will require completely transitioning from conventional petroleum-based jet fuel to sustainable alternatives.\\nThis collaboration is an example of California’s partnerships with industry to move toward a clean air future, and one that was made possible by the development of alternative fuels spurred by the state’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard program that provide the industry lower-carbon, sustainable options.\\n“California and the aviation industry are joining forces to tackle emissions head-on,” said Governor Gavin Newsom. “We’ve put the tools in place to incentivize cleaner fuels and spur innovation, creating opportunities like this to radically change how Californians can travel cleaner. This is a major step forward in our work to cut pollution, protect our communities, and build a future of cleaner air and innovative climate solutions.”\\n“California is once again demonstrating that smart climate action is good for the environment and good for business,” said CARB Chair Liane Randolph. “This partnership with the nation’s leading airlines brings the aviation industry onboard to advance a clean air future and will help accelerate development of sustainable fuel options and promote cleaner air travel within the state.”\\n\"A4A is pleased to launch a partnership with CARB focused on protecting the environment, reducing emissions, and increasing the use of SAF in California and across the country,” said Kevin Welsh, Vice President of Environmental Affairs and Chief Sustainability Officer at Airlines for America. “This partnership reflects the type of collaboration between government and the private sector that is necessary to achieve ambitious climate goals, and the agreement announced today reflects the strength of our commitment to a cleaner, more sustainable future for air travel.

Advocacy efforts that support innovative and thoughtful policy solutions are critical to building a more sustainable future of travel,” shared Amelia DeLuca, Chief Sustainability Officer at Delta Air Lines. “SAF is the best-known lever we have to decarbonize aviation, and with around 90% of Delta’s carbon emissions coming from jet fuel, we need as much SAF as we can get. That’s why we’re proud to have current offtake agreements in place to support our use of SAF in California, and why we will continue to work with value chain players and government partners like CARB to accelerate the development of SAF for the future.”\\n“Sustainable aviation fuel plays a critical role in the journey to Alaska Airlines’ aim of net zero carbon emissions by 2040. But there remains significant work to ensure that SAF is commercially viable and available at scale, and we need an industry-wide approach to address this challenge,” said Diana Birkett Rakow, SVP of Public Affairs and Sustainability at Alaska Airlines. “We appreciate CARB working alongside the industry to drive progress for aviation and the SAF ecosystem, and to advance this important energy solution in California and beyond.”'},\n",

This has displaced 320 million metric tons CO2 of gasoline and diesel emissions since the Program’s inception. That’s an amount equivalent 85% of today’s annual statewide greenhouse gas emissions. The growth in the use of renewable fuel is powering needed emissions reductions in the transportation sector.\\n“The proposal approved today strikes a balance between reducing the environmental and health impacts of transportation fuel used in California and ensuring that low-carbon options are available as the state continues to work toward a zero-emissions future,” said CARB Chair Liane Randolph. “Today’s approval increases consumer options beyond petroleum, provides a roadmap for cleaner air, and leverages private sector investment and federal incentives to spur innovation to address climate change and pollution.”\\nThe LCFS is designed to provide the most cost-effective path to support clean fuels and infrastructure. Affordability remains a key consideration for the Board, and it has directed staff to assess any impacts and potential mitigation from today’s adopted amendments on retail gasoline prices every six months and to submit an annual report beginning one year from the effective date of these amendments, and to collaborate with the California Energy Commission in that effort. The program currently limits the pass-through costs companies can shift to consumers by capping the price of credits that high-carbon-intensity fuel producing entities are required to purchase for compliance and allowing banking of credits bought at lower prices. Data from third party commodities markets experts shows the current LCFS pass through to California consumers is $0.10 per gallon of gasoline. This is consistent with the self-reported data by high-carbon-intensity fuel producers, which reflects an LCFS cost pass through to consumers of $0.08 to $0.10 per gallon of gasoline.\\nSupporting Californians\\nMaking electric vehicles more affordable: “The LCFS has also provided hundreds of millions of dollars of beneficial credits and incentives supporting the build-out of EV charging infrastructure and vehicle rebates which lower the upfront costs for drivers,” said a representative from MN8 Energy, which produces renewable energy, in a letter submitted to CARB.\\nExpanding access to charging infrastructure: As of October 10, 2024, there have been a total of 71 hydrogen stations and 749 fast EV charger sites approved under the Hydrogen Refueling Infrastructure (HRI) and (Fast Charging Infrastructure) FCI provisions of LCFS, respectively.\\nReducing health care costs associated with pollution from dirty fuels: CARB estimates $5 billion in savings from avoided health outcomes between 2024 and 2046.\\nIncreasing consumer choices, which drives price competition: “By using market-based policies that ensure the best ideas succeed, we can also maximize impact by marshaling private capital to invest in climate solutions. Fortunately, California already has an excellent example of this kind of approach in the Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS).”\\nReducing dependence on the oil industry, thereby protecting consumers from its associated supply and cost volatility: The LCFS has displaced more than 30 billion gallons of petroleum fuel.\\nThe LCFS sends long-term market signals to phase out combustion fuels and increase zero emission fuels and transportation options. The LCFS updates adopted by the Board were developed after a rigorous, years-long public rulemaking process that incorporated feedback received from interested parties. Updates include:\\nProviding billions of additional dollars to fund zero-emission vehicle charging and hydrogen fueling infrastructure, including new crediting opportunities for medium - and heavy-duty refueling infrastructure, to support implementation of California’s zero emission vehicle regulations.\\nIncreasing incentives for infrastructure in low-income neighborhoods and remote locations and ensuring that historically underserved communities receive needed investment to reduce emissions and provide equitable access to a clean air future.\\nPhasing out avoided methane crediting associated with the use of biomethane used as a combustion fuel, but extending the use of biomethane for renewable hydrogen to align with goals outlined in the 2022 Scoping Plan – the state’s plan for reducing climate-warming emissions and reaching carbon neutrality.\\nUpdated guardrails\\nThe LCFS updates also include new guardrails to avoid land use changes resulting in potential loss of food production or deforestation. The majority of biomass-based diesel and sustainable aviation fuel in the LCFS has historically come from waste feedstocks, such as used cooking oil, animal fat and inedible distiller’s corn oil. To minimize potential land use issues, the program will require fuel producers track crop-based and forestry-based feedstocks to their point of origin. The LCFS will also require independent feedstock certification to ensure biomass-based diesel and sustainable aviation fuel feedstocks are not undermining natural carbon stocks. Palm-derived fuels are also explicitly prohibited from receiving credits.\\nCalifornians will benefit from these program updates in numerous ways, including:\\nAs consumers increase their use of low carbon intensity fuels and more efficient vehicles, fuel costs per mile will be reduced by 42 percent - translating to savings of over $20 billion in fuel expenditures every year by 2045. For light-duty vehicles (cars, pickup trucks, sport utility vehicles, vans, and minivans) these fuel cost savings will be even more pronounced, cutting today’s costs to Californians by more than 50 percent.\\nThe amount of LCFS proceeds invested in disadvantaged communities for clean fuel and transportation projects is estimated to be approximately $4.8 billion in the next decade.\\nCalifornians are expected to save almost $5 billion in health care costs by avoiding the impacts of air pollution.\\nThe amendments will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 558 million metric tons, NOx by more than 25,500 tons and PM 2.5 by more than 4,200 tons between 2025 and 2045.'},\n",

It is made from renewable biomass and/or waste. The agreement accelerates solutions to California’s climate and air quality goals by partnering with the aviation industry in emissions reduction efforts, and it supports a commitment by the major U.S. airlines to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, which will require completely transitioning from conventional petroleum-based jet fuel to sustainable alternatives.\\nThis collaboration is an example of California’s partnerships with industry to move toward a clean air future, and one that was made possible by the development of alternative fuels spurred by the state’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard program that provide the industry lower-carbon, sustainable options.\\n“California and the aviation industry are joining forces to tackle emissions head-on,” said Governor Gavin Newsom. “We’ve put the tools in place to incentivize cleaner fuels and spur innovation, creating opportunities like this to radically change how Californians can travel cleaner. This is a major step forward in our work to cut pollution, protect our communities, and build a future of cleaner air and innovative climate solutions.”\\n“California is once again demonstrating that smart climate action is good for the environment and good for business,” said CARB Chair Liane Randolph. “This partnership with the nation’s leading airlines brings the aviation industry onboard to advance a clean air future and will help accelerate development of sustainable fuel options and promote cleaner air travel within the state.”\\n\"A4A is pleased to launch a partnership with CARB focused on protecting the environment, reducing emissions, and increasing the use of SAF in California and across the country,” said Kevin Welsh, Vice President of Environmental Affairs and Chief Sustainability Officer at Airlines for America. “This partnership reflects the type of collaboration between government and the private sector that is necessary to achieve ambitious climate goals, and the agreement announced today reflects the strength of our commitment to a cleaner, more sustainable future for air travel. We\\'re excited to work with CARB and other SAF stakeholders to further our industry\\'s efforts to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.\"\\nA4A’s members include Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, Atlas Air Worldwide, Delta Air Lines, FedEx, Hawaiian Airlines, jetBlue Airways, Southwest Airlines, United Airlines, UPS, and associate member Air Canada. Key goals of the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Partnership include:\\nCARB and A4A will work together with sustainable aviation fuel producers, aviation stakeholders, and the federal government to ensure that at least 200 million gallons of cost-competitive options are available for use by airlines within California by 2035.\\nTo achieve these goals, CARB and A4A will work together to identify, evaluate, and prioritize new policies and actions, including incentives for investment and timely permitting to help accelerate the availability and use of sustainable aviation fuels for intrastate flights in California.\\nThe partnership will establish a Sustainable Aviation Fuel Working Group of government and industry stakeholders that will meet annually to report progress and address barriers to meeting these goals.\\nCARB staff will create a public website that will display the latest information on the availability and use of conventional jet fuel and sustainable aviation fuel within California, as well as details on relevant state and federal incentives and policies.\\nIn addition to bolstering climate action in California, this agreement supports and builds on the climate goals outlined in the federal government’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge, a national initiative to develop a comprehensive strategy for scaling up new technologies to produce sustainable aviation fuels on a commercial scale.\\nRead the agreement\\nBelow are quotes from A4A member airlines regarding the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Partnership:\\n\"Delta is appreciative for the partnership and work CARB and Airlines for America are doing to accelerate the transition to SAF.

The new language maintained a proposal to make the program's annual targets 9pc tougher in 2025 and to achieve by 2030 a 30pc reduction from 2010 transportation fuel carbon intensity levels.\\nCARB staff's latest proposals, published a little before midnight ET on 1 October, offer comparatively minor adjustments to the shock August revisions that spurred a nearly $20 after-hours rally in LCFS prompt prices. Prompt credits early in Wednesday's session traded higher by $3 than they closed the previous trading day.\\nLCFS programs require yearly reductions in transportation fuel carbon intensity. Higher-carbon fuels that exceed these annual limits incur deficits that suppliers must offset with credits generated from the distribution to the market of approved, lower-carbon alternatives.\\nCalifornia's program has helped spur a rush of new US renewable diesel production capacity, swamping west coast fuel markets and inundating the state's LCFS program with compliance credits. CARB reported more than 26mn metric tonnes of credits on hand by April this year — more than double the number of new program deficits generated in all of 2023. Staff have sought through this year's rulemaking to restore incentives to more deeply decarbonize state transportation than thought possible during revisions last made in 2019.\\nCalifornia formally began this rulemaking process in early January after publishing draft proposals in late December. Regulators initially proposed adjusting 2025 targets lower by 5pc for 2025 — a one-time decrease called a stepdown — to work toward a 30pc reduction target for 2030.\\nCARB set its sights on 21 March for adoption. But staff pulled that proposal in February as hundreds of comments in response poured in.\\nUpdated language released on 12 August proposed a steeper stepdown for 2025 of 9pc while keeping the 30pc target for 2030. The proposal also added a limit on credit generation from certain crop-based feedstocks, to 20pc of the associated volume delivered to California in certain cases.\\nRespondents generally supported the tougher targets, though fuel suppliers warned of higher prices and some credit generators argued that the state should be even more ambitious.\\nNo one praised the proposed limits on credit generation.

If approved, it will increase the degree to which fuel producers must offset their petroleum-based fuels with low-carbon alternatives. RNG groups say that will go a long way toward restoring favorable credit prices that can allow existing projects to generate revenue and support the creation of new projects at landfills, farms and elsewhere.\\n“That’s the biggest news to come out of this latest package,” Adam Schubert, a senior associate with fuels intelligence firm Stillwater Associates, said. “Credit prices ... are so low that firms can’t justify investment in the production of the low-carbon fuels that are needed for the standard to actually happen.”\\nCARB’s proposal would change the carbon intensity reduction target for 2025 from 5% to 9%. The target, which ratchets up annually, guides credit buyers to adopt a steadily increasing amount of cleaner fuels either directly or through credits.\\nThis is the second time CARB has embarked on a major amendment process for the Low Carbon Fuel Standard, which was first implemented in 2011. Since this revision process began in earnest last year, agency staff have had to field competing priorities from a range of industries, including vehicle manufacturers, fossil and alternative fuel producers, agriculture and others.\\nGroups representing renewable natural gas producers — including large landfill owners and anaerobic digestion facility developers — offered measured praise for this latest proposal.\\nIn a statement on Tuesday, American Biogas Council Executive Director Patrick Serfass said the group was appreciative of CARB’s decision to change the carbon intensity reduction target, though he noted other changes may deter investment after 2030. \\n\"This positive change will do exactly what the LCFS is designed to do: more dramatically decrease carbon emissions in California. It will also increase demand for renewable transportation fuels from biogas,\" Serfass wrote.\\nKeep up with the story. Subscribe to the Waste Dive free daily newsletter\\nSam Wade, director of public policy for the RNG Coalition, similarly issued a statement in support of the move. He has previously pushed the agency to get more aggressive in its carbon intensity reduction timeline, telling Waste Dive in May he believed the agency could have gone farther than a 9% reduction if it wished.\\nBut it’s not just industry groups jockeying for changes to the program. CARB has also faced criticism from environmental justice advocates, including its own Environmental Justice Advisory Committee. The committee has urged CARB to move the credit program away from combustion fuels more quickly by lowering the volume of incentives for fuels derived from crops like soybeans or methane derived from large-scale dairy farms.\\nBut agency staff have been reluctant to change those incentives, arguing that doing so could starve the program of renewable fuel credits that petroleum fuel producers need to buy in order to be in compliance. \\nThe update released this week offers those advocates a small victory but does not address their demands. CARB proposed setting a limit on the amount of credits that “biomass-based diesel” fuels like those produced with soybean oil can earn, essentially only crediting the fuel up to a certain point for manufacturers before cutting off the benefit.\\nThe agency also proposed to tweak avoided methane credits, a key mechanism that environmental justice groups want to see axed.\\nAvoided methane credits work by offering additional credits — that is, beyond the standard alternative fuel credits created by the program — to a fuel producer that is taking methane that would otherwise be emitted into the atmosphere and turning it into a fuel.\\nIn practice, this has meant a huge incentive for anaerobic digesters on dairy farms, which receive credits not just for producing RNG itself but also by avoiding methane emissions from dairy cow manure. Such facilities have enjoyed some of the lowest carbon intensity scores in the LCFS system and are highly attractive as credit, and therefore cash, generators.\\nCARB said it would phase out avoided methane credits for dairy farms by 2040 in a proposal from earlier this year. Environmental justice advocates condemned that decision, arguing it locks in an incentive for large, polluting farms to continue operating as normal for years.

Aviation is responsible for 11% of transportation greenhouse (GHG) emissions, making it the third largest contributor of transportation emissions. Transitioning to sustainable liquid fuels has been identified as the path with the greatest long-term opportunity to decarbonize the aviation sector.\\nSAF production is already in place and is expected to triple from 2023 levels to approximately 1.875 billion liters in 2024. Supply chains continue to mature and existing industrial infrastructure is being leveraged for SAF production. Investments in SAF have increased due to federal and state tax credits incentivizing production.\\nAlthough SAF production has increased significantly, the 2024 level will account for only 0.53% of aviation\\'s fuel requirements and 6% of renewable fuel production. There remain hurdles to the scalability and widespread adoption of SAF. SAF currently is not a one-to-one replacement or as energy dense as conventional jet fuel, and limited production capacity contributes to higher costs.\\nAs the industry continues to make headway toward a low-carbon and sustainable aviation future, continued innovation, regulatory stability, public-private partnerships, and investments are needed to help overcome the challenges and barriers to reducing the aviation sector\\'s GHG emissions.\\nWhat is sustainable aviation fuel?\\nSAF is an alternative fuel that can be produced from non-petroleum feedstocks such as used cooking oil, greases, fats, municipal solid waste, algae, agricultural and forestry waste and residues, wood mill waste, and dedicated energy crops. SAF is a \"drop-in\" fuel, meaning it can be blended with traditional fossil jet fuel at different levels depending on the feedstock and how it is produced.\\nCommitments, incentives, and programs driving aviation decarbonization\\nSeveral initiatives and commitments have placed the aviation sector at the forefront of decarbonization efforts. The Biden administration has set a goal of net-zero GHG emissions economy-wide by 2050. Additionally, through the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge launched in 2021, the US Department of Energy (DOE), the US Department of Transportation (DOT), and the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) continue to work toward reducing SAF cost, enhancing its sustainability, achieving a minimum of 50% reduction in lifecycle GHG emissions compared to conventional fuel, and expanding SAF production and use.\\nTogether, the DOE, DOT, and USDA are accelerating the research, development, demonstration, and deployment of SAF needed to scale up production to 3 billion gallons per year by 2030 and 35 billion gallons per year by 2050.\\nIn addition, members of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) committed to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. The Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA, opens new tab), a global market-based measure designed to offset international aviation emissions, encourages the use of SAF by allowing aircraft operators to reduce their offsetting requirement through the use of eligible fuels, which include CORSIA SAF.\\nThrough the Inflation Reduction Act, SAF producers are eligible for a tax credit of $1.25 per gallon of qualifying SAF that reduces GHG emissions by 50%, and an additional $0.01 per gallon for each percent the reduction exceeds 50%, up to $0.50 per gallon.\\nIn addition, several states have implemented tax credit programs that are designed to stimulate the in-state production and consumption of SAF. For example, in Minnesota, opens new tab, companies that produce or blend SAF sold between June 30, 2024, and July 1, 2030, can qualify for a tax credit of $1.50 per gallon.\\nTo qualify, the SAF must (1) be derived from biomass and not from palm fatty acid distillates, (2) reduce at least 50% lifecycle GHG emissions, (3) be produced in Minnesota or blended with aviation, gasoline, or jet fuel in Minnesota, and (4) be sold in Minnesota to a purchaser who certifies that the SAF is for use as fuel in an aircraft departing from an airport in Minnesota.\\nIn addition to these tax incentives, several states have established low carbon fuel programs that issue credits in support of low carbon fuel production. For example, California established the Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS, opens new tab) to decrease the carbon intensity of California\\'s transportation fuel pool and encourage low carbon fuel production. Providers of transportation fuels must demonstrate that the mix of fuels they offer in California meet the LCFS carbon intensity standards or benchmarks for each annual compliance period, or purchase credits to meet the standards.\\nFuels and fuel blendstocks that have a carbon intensity higher than the benchmark generate deficits, while fuels and fuel blendstocks that have a carbon intensity below the benchmark generate c'},\n",

              "  'second_title': None,\n",
              "  'content': \"Many industries have and continue to incorporate hydrogen and fuel cell technologies as part of their decarbonization efforts, a crucial aspect of addressing climate change. New hydrogen fuel cell vehicles have been debuted, and fuel cells have been identified as a viable zero-emission replacement for heavy-duty vehicles, which account for about 25% of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the transportation sector, making them a key target for decarbonization efforts.\\nDeploying hydrogen fuel cell technologies at scale will require alignment of multiple factors, including the production, transportation, and storage of hydrogen and maintaining a reliable hydrogen supply. This alignment is essential to mitigate climate change by reducing emissions and promoting sustainability.\\nWhy hydrogen?\\nThe incorporation of hydrogen and fuel cell technologies is supported by the inherent benefits of the technology for the climate, as well as government funding, incentives, and mandates. In addition to being a zero-emission technology, hydrogen fuel cell vehicles can operate at full power without loss of voltage before refueling, withstand cold environments, and refuel quickly.\\nSubstantial government funding and incentives are available to support hydrogen infrastructure, clean hydrogen production, and fuel cell technology development, demonstration, and deployment. Most recently, the Biden administration made available $1.3 billion for electric vehicle charging and hydrogen, propane, and natural gas fueling infrastructure in urban and rural communities and along designated highways, interstates, and major roadways.\\nThis funding opportunity helps implement the National Zero-Emission Freight Corridor Strategy, which prioritizes and sequences the deployment of zero-emission medium-duty and heavy-duty vehicle charging and hydrogen fueling infrastructure in key hubs and corridors between 2024 and 2040.\\nFederal and state mandates, commitments, and strategies have prioritized decarbonization of hard-to-abate sectors, such as the transportation sector. For example, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued stronger standards to reduce GHG emissions from heavy-duty vehicles beginning in model year 2027. In addition, states such as California have mandated the transition to zero-emission vehicles. These standards and mandates are expected to accelerate the transition and adoption of zero-emission vehicles, which will be key to addressing climate change in the coming decades.\\nHydrogen production, transportation and storage\\nHydrogen can be produced in several ways and using different sources, which contribute to the environmental impact of the hydrogen produced. For example, green hydrogen is produced by electrolysis of water using renewable electricity, making it a clean and sustainable energy source. Blue hydrogen is produced from natural gas using steam methane reformation (SMR), and the carbon dioxide is captured and stored, mitigating the environmental impact of the production process. On the other hand, grey hydrogen is produced through the same process, but the carbon dioxide is not captured.\\nGenerally, the lower the environmental impact of the hydrogen, the more expensive it is to produce. However, federal tax incentives, such as the hydrogen production tax credit under Section 45V of the Internal Revenue Code and the investment tax credit under Section 48, and credits available at the state level, such as the California Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) credits, can help reduce the overall cost.\\nAnother benefit of hydrogen is that it can be produced at a location relatively close to the point of consumption, though some form of transportation to the end user is often required. Pipelines are one option, but existing pipeline infrastructure is largely concentrated in the Gulf Coast and California. Hydrogen can also be transported in compressed form by truck, ship, or barge, but this can be costly.\\nHowever, the expansion of hydrogen infrastructure needed for nationwide transportation and distribution is underway through efforts such as the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs Program and fueling infrastructure funding opportunities.\\nThere are also storage considerations for hydrogen. Storing it as a gas requires high-pressure tanks, while storing it as a liquid requires well-insulated cryogenic storage vessels. Whether hydrogen can be stored onsite depends on several factors, including whether the site can accommodate the equipment needed to store hydrogen. DOE has made available funding to support the research, development, and demonstration of hydrogen storage vessels, hydrogen fueling and transfer components.\\nImportance of affordable and reliable hydrogen supply\\nMaintaining an affordable and reliable supply of hydrogen remains one of the most significant issues facing the use of hydrogen and the adoption of fuel cell technologies in decarbonization efforts. The availability, accessibility\"},\n",

The fuel has also been promoted as a way to cut emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx), a harmful pollutant that contributes to ozone deterioration and causes respiratory problems.\\nHowever, engines made more recently emit more NOx when running on renewable diesel when blended with 35% biodiesel or more, compared with conventional diesel, according to a study released by California Air Resources Board (CARB) in November.\\nCARB found in these new technology diesel engines, or NTDEs, running on 100% renewable diesel, NOx emissions increases were not statistically significant compared with CARB diesel,\\nThat could affect the way regulators revise the LCFS, which spurred investment in renewable diesel, made from fats and vegetable oils.\\nState regulators are considering changes to the LCFS that align with a 2022 update on how to bring the state to carbon neutrality by 2045. The study means regulators could have to consider whether renewable diesel increases emissions in areas with worse air quality.\\nCARB said it has \"identified several questions about the study results\" that require further evaluation, and will be accepting public comment on the study until the end of January.\\nRegulators did not respond to a request for comment.\\nHeavy-duty vehicles are one of the largest contributors to NOx emissions - a precursor of ozone and particulate matter formation. Improved emissions control technology has helped NOx emissions fall by 60% between 1990 and 2019 nationwide, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\\nCompanies and regulators had previously purported that renewable diesel reduced NOx emissions by 10%, citing the results of earlier studies that examined the fuel\\'s performance in older engines.\\nBut trucks with newer engines that ran renewable diesel did not meaningfully lower NOx emissions, according to the study. While these NTDEs are present in only 43% of the state’s commercial vehicle registrations, they account for more than 75% of the miles traveled among the state\\'s heavy-duty fleet.\\n“CARB threw caution to the wind and opened the door to renewable diesel\\'s unlimited use without having properly studied NOx emissions impact in NTDEs,” said Pat McDuff, chief executive officer at Glendale-based California Fueling, in a public comment submitted in January.\\nHe urged California regulators to reverse regulatory changes that prohibit his company from selling fuel additives meant to decrease NOx emissions in biodiesel.\\nThe state is trying to bring 19 regions into compliance with air quality standards enacted in 2015. In two regions - the south coast and the San Joaquin Valley Air Basin - CARB has targeted lowering NOx emissions as one way of improving air quality. In 2020 regulators adopted a new regulation to reduce NOx emissions 90% by 2027.\\nRenewable diesel generally cuts greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants, said Tristan Brown, associate professor of energy resource economics at SUNY and advisor on New York\\'s Climate Action Council.\\nBrown noted most biodiesel blending in the United States is 20% or less. \"The real question is what amount of NOx is emitted by NTDE engines at volumes of 10% and 20% biodiesel blend levels, and that is not reported by the study,\" Brown said.'},\n",

The U.S. Energy Department projects renewable diesel will be about 7% of the overall diesel pool by 2030; it is currently just 5%.\\nHowever, the price of LCFS credits in California, which are generated and traded by companies that produce fuel at a lower carbon intensity than a benchmark set by various states, has fallen nearly 30% in the last two months to below $145 per metric ton of carbon, according to California\\'s Air Resources Board (CARB).\\nThat is the result of rising renewable diesel sales as refiners plan to boost output of the fuel, according to industry experts.

California has created one of the biggest regional carbon markets for the transportation sector, which state regulators say is one of the most effective ways of reducing carbon emissions from road fuel.\\nIn 2020, CARB said LCFS credit generation met nearly all of the state\\'s target reduction for carbon emissions. The LCFS sets annual carbon intensity (CI) standards, or benchmarks, which become more stringent over time.\\nBut other states have struggled to coordinate with each other to introduce their own low carbon programs, which would open up additional markets for the growing supply of renewable energy and raise credit prices again.\\nLast month, an East Coast low-carbon program five years in the making that would have included Massachusetts and Connecticut died after various governors expressed concern that the program would raise gasoline prices. California currently has the highest gasoline prices in the nation at $4.70 a gallon.\\nThe program would have required large gasoline and diesel suppliers to purchase auctionable “allowances” for the pollution caused by combustion of fuels sold in participating areas.\\nGasoline-related trade groups opposed the idea, saying it would harm, rather than promote, use of fuels that produce fewer pollutants by failing to effectively encourage investment in alternative fuels.\\nStakeholders are now eying New York, which may adopt a policy backed by the New York Climate Action Council that would call for significantly increased investment in renewable diesel through 2030.\\n\"The replacement of diesel with renewable diesel and green hydrogen will reduce harmful fine particulate matter emissions in disadvantaged communities,\" the council said in a draft plan released in October.'},\n",

              "  'content': 'AT A GLANCE\\n• Palm oil and soybean oil have long been used in cooking, but their growing use as a biofuel is causing a spike in demand\\n• Ukraine’s reduced exports of sunflower oil are creating an additional surge in demand for other edible oils\\nEdible oil prices have hit record highs this year driven by strong demand. The diversification of the use of edible oils into a biofuel has led to the commodity becoming an increasingly important part of the agriculture complex.\\nPalm oil is the most commonly produced edible oil, followed by soybean oil, with rapeseed oil and sunflower oil accounting for a smaller share of the market. Production of palm oil is highly concentrated, with 85% of the world’s supply coming from Indonesia and Malaysia. Meanwhile, soybeans, from which soybean oil is extracted, are largely grown in North and South America.\\nGrowing Demand, Constrained Supply\\nWhile edible oils have long been used in cooking and as a food ingredient in varied food formulations, it is their growing use as biofuel that is behind the recent spike in demand. As governments around the world introduce mandates stipulating that a certain percentage of fuel must come from renewable sources, such as California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard, demand for biofuel has soared. Given the massive size of the energy landscape, combined with many countries setting net zero carbon targets, there is potential for demand in this area to grow significantly in the years ahead. In fact, the market for edible oils is expected to grow at a compound rate of 7.6% between now and 2029.\\nIn the past, supply has largely been able to meet demand. Soybeans compete with corn in terms of agricultural acreage. As a result, when high demand leads to elevated soybean prices, farmers traditionally switch from growing corn to soybeans, enabling this demand to be met and prices to stabilize.\\nBut supply of palm and soybean oil has not been able to keep pace with the rising demand caused by the growing use of both oils for biofuel. The trees from which palm oil is extracted take time to grow, while there has also not been a significant increase in agricultural land given over to soybean production. As a result of this mismatch between supply and demand, prices have risen. At the same time, the steep increase in energy prices has put further upward pressure on edible oils, due to their use as a biofuel.\\nOver the shorter term, the war in Ukraine has further stoked edible oil prices. Russia and Ukraine account for nearly 80% of global sunflower oil exports, but exports have been hit by sanctions on Russia and Ukrainian ports being closed. Edible oils tend to be interchangeable, so countries which were previously major consumers of sunflower oil, have switched to palm oil and soybean oil, creating an additional surge in demand. Meanwhile, labor disruption caused by Covid-19 in Malaysia has hit production and put further pressure on prices.\\nPalm Oil Soars on Export Ban\\nPalm oil prices soared to a record high earlier this year and have experienced a strong upward trajectory since May 2020. In addition to the factors discussed above, the spike was driven by political developments in Indonesia, which is the world’s largest palm oil producer. In February, the Indonesian government implemented the Domestic Market Obligation, under which producers had to set aside 20% of their shipments for local buyers. This was followed by an export ban in late April. Although the ban was lifted three weeks later, it created significant uncertainty in the market, as Indonesia accounts for 60% of global supply. This disruption to supply pushed palm oil prices up to their new record high.\\nBiofuel Demand for Soybean Oil share\\nSoybean oil prices also hit a record high earlier this year. Prices started to increase dramatically at the start of 2021 driven by the combination of the California mandate on biofuel, as well as bad weather scares during the soybean growing season. Soybeans produce both oil and meal, with the price of the two determining, and in turn, being determined by the price of soybeans. Traditionally, meal has been the more valuable of the two components, but the rise in demand for biofuel has increased the value of the oil share, with soybean oil briefly worth more than soybean meal earlier this year.\\nMeanwhile, high wheat prices as a result of the war in Ukraine, have driven the price of corn higher. As a result, some farmers have opted to continue to plant corn, rather than soybeans, suggesting supply will remain tight and prices high.\\nManaging Price Risk\\nThe recent price rises have led to significant fluctuations between the soybean oil and palm oil spread. Soybean oil and palm oil are considered “substitute goods” because they can often be used interchangeably. Even so, in the past soybean oil has traded at a premium in the $100 to $150 per metric ton range over palm oil. The steep increase in soybean oil’s price saw this premium soar to $500 per metric ton i'},\n",

That policy, which now mandates billions of gallons of ethanol and other biofuels be blended into the nation’s fuel pool, also requires a reduction in carbon intensity compared to petroleum-based fuels.\\nHANDFUL OF PROJECTS\\nEthanol groups say that their supply chain, which already produces and transports huge volumes of ethanol per year, thanks to the RFS, would be readily available to help boost production of SAF to meet the administration\\'s goals.\\nBut so far, only a handful of ethanol-to-SAF projects have been proposed.\\nLanzaJet, for example, is building in Georgia an alcohol-to-jet production facility using ethanol as a feedstock which is due to be completed in 2023, and which the company says would be the world\\'s first facility of its kind.\\nThe project would produce 10 million gallons of SAF and renewable diesel per year – a tiny fraction of the roughly 24.7 billion gallons of petroleum-based jet fuel now produced in the U.S. annually.\\nGevo has said it expects to develop, own, and operate ethanol-to-jet plants to produce SAF. The company has agreements with Delta Air Lines and American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O), opens new tab to supply each with tens of millions of gallons of SAF per year for several years starting in 2026.\\nEngineering and aerospace giant Honeywell International Inc (HON.O), opens new tab has also announced a new ethanol-to-jet fuel processing technology.'},\n",

Because Siemens (henceforth referred to as the Technology Owner) has developed, tested, and piloted a proprietary post-combustion CO2-capture technology (PostCapTM) for the removal of CO2 from the flue gas of coal- and gas-fired power plants suitable for the project, both parties decided to cooperate in executing a front-end engineering and design (FEED) study. The technology is based on an aqueous amino-acid-salt solution.\\nThe Technology Owner and Masdar have completed a FEED study for capturing 1,800,000 tons of CO2 annually from a natural-gas-fired power plant in Abu Dhabi by application of the PostCapTM technology.\\nVarious opportunities and challenges were encountered during the design of the retrofit capture plant. Challenges were often specific to the region, including local climate, water availability, and flue-gas quality. Design and optimization of the plant were influenced by local energy and labor prices. Further opportunities included integration with the power plant and with a local industrial facility. The power plant had to supply the capture plant with steam and power without reducing the original electricity-production capacity. To accomplish this, several heat- and power-integration concepts were evaluated with respect to their feasibility, including the application of a backpressure steam turbine and the retrofit of a simple-cycle gas turbine to combined-cycle gas turbine.\\nVarious cooling options were considered in view of climate and resource challenges. Cooling water had to be extracted from a re-flux stream produced by an adjacent industrial facility.\\nDrawing on the results of the FEED study, this paper presents the manner in which PostCapTM technology can be applied for capturing CO2 at a power plant in Abu Dhabi for the purpose of EOR, while satisfying specific local needs, and the way utility supply and power plant integration can be facilitated.'},\n",

Chances are your child in elementary school has also heard about it. It has been center stage in all local, national, and international political and environmental debates. I am not going to talk about it here. What I am going to articulate here is what we can do about it in our own way. By “we,” I mean we as individuals, we as SPE members, and we as oil and gas industry professionals.\\nFirst, the bad news: Indeed, there are a lot of challenges with CO2. It is a stable compound and does not readily disintegrate. The biggest challenge perhaps is the cost of capturing CO2. Most of the anthropogenic CO2 is available from fixed sources such as power plants. The CO2 first has to be separated from nitrogen, then compressed, and finally piped and pumped into a subterranean reservoir for oil recovery or storage. All of these steps are expensive.\\nNow the good news: It can be done. And we, as petroleum engineers and Earth scientists, are best suited to do it. We know our reservoirs, we have produced from them, and we can ensure that CO2 can be sent back safely and securely into them. Supercritical CO2 is an excellent solvent, especially for lighter crude oils. If it were free, or as low in cost as water, we would be injecting CO2 instead of water for its favorable properties.\\nSo how can we help? There are many areas and applications of CO2 in the oil and gas industry. CO2 enhanced oil recovery (EOR) is the bedrock and the mainstay in our application portfolio. A lot has been published in that area. At present, there remain several challenges with CO2 EOR. These include gravity override, poor sweep efficiency, and economic factors. Considerable work and research are ongoing to address all of these challenges. The papers that follow address some of them: an example of chemical-looping emerging technology in a bid to reduce CO2-capture costs; CO2 foams for improved oil recovery; commercial-scale demonstration projects; and use of CO2 in tight gas and unconventional resources.'},\n",

With extensive research linking GHG concentrations in the atmosphere to observed changes in global temperature patterns, CCS technology could play an important role in policy efforts to limit the global average temperature rise.\\nEven with the wealth of experience already in place within the oil and gas industry, the obstacles to advancing CCS to the forefront of GHG mitigation technologies remain significant. Large-scale CO2 injection projects remain primarily in the realm of commercial CO2-EOR (enhanced oil recovery) projects. The key challenges to enabling CCS include cost-effective capture and transport of industrial CO2, clear access to pore space for CO2 storage in geologic formations, proven methodologies for demonstrating storage integrity, and dissemination of best practices. SPE members can play a significant role in addressing these challenges.\\nCost-Effective Capture of Power Sector and Industrial CO2\\nA major technical challenge facing capture at electric generating facilities is that the CO2 concentration in large-\\xadvolume flue streams is quite low. Current removal technologies include techniques that apply amines, chilled ammonia, membranes, and ionic liquids to strip the CO2 from the flue stream. How\\xadever, these technologies were developed to handle smaller-scale operations and \\xadhigher-CO2-purity streams. When applied to large electric generating plants, process efficiency is reduced, and the energy penalty associated with the capture process drives up costs, increasing the levelized cost of electricity by 50% or more, depending on local factors. Also, to accommodate the substantial volumes of the CO2 and flue gas at full-scale industrial sources, the removal technologies require significant scale up and footprint for deployment.\\nWhile early movers are developing large-scale capture demonstrations such as SaskPower’s Boundary Dam Project, Southern Company’s Kemper Energy Facility (Fig. 1 above), and NRG’s Petro Nova Facility, we are still very early on the “learning curve.” Support for more development of next-generation capture technologies and large demonstrations is required to push us down the cost curve. This involves reducing the cost of materials and construction, parasitic costs related to energy for operations, compression, and operation and maintenance costs.\\nGovernment Oversight Challenges\\nMany of the aspects of a CO2 storage project mirror those of CO2-EOR projects. The land department is in charge of securing the acreage position, geoscientists describe the reservoir and seal, and engineers design the surface and subsurface equipment as well as provide a plan to maximize the value proposition offered across the acreage. In addition, some type of unitization may be required of disparate mineral and pore space owners. Finally, there is typically a state or federal permitting or oversight agency to ensure the project complies with established environmental requirements.\\nHowever, CO2 storage is currently viewed as a “waste management” activity, with perhaps little public buy-in or perceived economic benefit to the local population, particularly in areas with little to no hydrocarbon extraction industry presence. In the US, this is further exacerbated by the fact that ownership of pore space in which storage would occur is generally retained by the surface owner and the hydrocarbons are maintained by the mineral owner/lessee, and multiple owners/lessees may be involved. A well-conceived outreach strategy combined with mechanisms for ensuring both local benefits and trustworthy environmental stewardship are required to obtain local public and stakeholder acceptance of the storage projects.\\nBecause of this disparate ownership, an alternative option to ameliorate pore-space access issues is to consider offshore storage using existing or new platforms. While the offshore drilling and operations cost is considerably higher, the government commonly holds the pore and mineral rights, diminishing the number of stakeholders potentially involved.\\nSafe, Secure, Large-Scale CO2 Storage\\nA major difference between CO2 injection and hydrocarbon production is the fact that injected CO2 has to be accommodated in the subsurface by compression into the formation and pore water, increasing reservoir pressure. Determining the reservoir continuity at distance without drilling many costly appraisal wells and the resultant pressure accommodated storage capacity is a saline formation challenge. In addition, CO2 has a much higher mobility than water, and with a lower density shows strong gravity segregation. Plume modeling strategies, coupled with advanced geophysical techniques for calibration, are an area of continuing focus, particularly where laterally extensive CO2 plumes develop. Once the primary pressure accommodation space has been used, the challenge may be to develop reservoir engineering strategies to use the remaining pore space more efficiently for storage. Extraction of brine could increase storage efficiency and reduce the area affected by a pressure plume.\\nDepleted Fields and Existing Infrastructure\\nDepleted oil and gas fields offer proven secure storage—the capacity is well understood and the storage security is proven. However, they introduce some challenges. When a gas field is highly depleted, the CO2 will initially be in the gas phase, yet it is transported in the dense phase. There are a number of potential solutions that include heating, starting in gas phase, or introducing methane or nitrogen. Management of the movement of the fluid through the phase envelope is therefore key, and requires the exploitation of CO2-EOR expertise coupled with potentially novel petroleum engineering solutions. The assessment, monitoring, and repair of legacy wells is also important when dealing with depleted fields.\\nDemonstrating Secure Storage\\nScaling up CO2 storage technology to address climate change, while demonstrating to stakeholders that the process is safe and secure, is a significant challenge. The 40-plus years of experience gained in the design and operation of CO2-EOR projects provides the primary foundation for establishing a com\\xadparable understanding for the issues associated with CO2 storage. CCS-\\xadspecific monitoring, permitting, and long-term care programs must be \\xadestablished and applied to develop commercial sites. Risk assessment is an essential activity during the selection and qualification of sites for long-term storage of CO2, for the development of a risk management strategy, and in establishing guidelines for safe and effective operations. While geologic uncertainties/risks are highly site-specific, the main perceived risks are of potential CO2 or brine leakage from wells and \\xadgeologic pathways, and induced seismicity and  ground displacement.\\nWorldwide, a considerable amount of CCS regulatory framework development has occurred. In most cases, these efforts build upon existing frameworks for regulating oil and gas activities. For example, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has published underground injection control well requirements for the geologic storage of CO2, based on protection of underground drinking water sources, and has established reporting requirements under its Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program for facilities that inject CO2 underground for both CO2-EOR and geologic storage. Importantly, EPA guidance confirms that CO2-EOR can result in stored CO2. Nonetheless, substantial legal and regulatory concerns remain.\\nDealing With Abundant CO2\\nShould CO2 capture become cost-effective, the volume of CO2 available for transportation and injection would require significant expansion of the current infrastructure. Today, 50 individual CO2 pipelines with a combined length of more than 7,250 km (4,500 miles) exist in the United States. Should 10% of total emissions be captured, it would far exceed the transport ability of this infrastructure. To bridge this gap, considerable infrastructure development is needed. Early delivery targets for CO2 would include areas where well infrastructure is already in place, such as large oil fields, while areas with minimal oil and gas development would be developed later for CO2 storage. While the capabilities exist to build the infrastructure, the task will require a tremendous influx of capital and personnel, and regulatory cooperation.\\nLarge volumes of low-cost, readily available CO2 could allow for the development of new EOR strategies, using CO2 in excess of traditional practice. These techniques could include vertical or gravity-stable flooding protocols that may effectively recover the bulk of the remaining oil, while also using less water. Also, larger hydrocarbon pore volume injections in traditional horizontal floods, and possibly earlier application of CO2-EOR, might be adopted in lieu of waterflooding. New best practices for these cases would need to be developed and shared within the industry.\\nDevelopment and Dissemination of Best Practices\\nThe need for timely dissemination of CO2 storage projects best practices is key to the widespread deployment of the technology. While CO2-EOR serves as an analogue for CO2 storage, and many best practices are transferable, notable differences exist. These include regulations and regulatory entities, ownership issues, short- and long-term liability, public outreach and pressure/plume management. We believe that SPE has a role to play in the documentation and dissemination of CO2 storage best practices through support of publications and conferences/forums.'},\n",

His remarks were notable in part because they come as ExxonMobil faces accusations that it has historically downplayed its knowledge of the risks associated with climate change. \\nSeveral company projects were listed during the speech, ones that Woods emphasized are aimed at reducing emissions and increasing energy efficiency such as making biofuels from agricultural waste and algae. He also noted that ExxonMobil has a stake in about 25% of the world’s carbon-capture-and-sequestration capacity and that the company plans to invest more in this area.\\nLast year, the company also announced that it has partnered with technology developers to find out whether carbon fuel cells can be used to efficiently capture carbon dioxide on a large scale. Woods said that if this project can be used to capture emissions from power plants then it may bring about “a future in which hydrocarbon use and decarbonization go hand in hand.”\\nWhen it comes to the role of governments in such carbon-reducing innovation, Woods was cautious. He said governments can help drive innovation by opening up trade channels and creating transparent carbon pricing structures—something that ExxonMobil has supported in the past—but he knocked down mandates and subsidies for renewable energies, saying they “only hinder progress.”\"},\n",

The important question is how we can keep up with the many new and unique challenges posed by this fast-paced change.\\nThe oil and gas industry faces a very challenging future. Energy demand continues to grow, while our mature fields are declining.

Our task is to extend the life of the industry by improving the success of finding new discoveries in frontier and remote basins, increasing the ultimate recovery from existing fields, as well as the need to find ways to tap into unconventional resources. At the same time, we must intensify our focus on sustainability, which calls for meeting humanity’s needs without harming future generations.

              "  'second_title': None,\n",
              "  'content': 'To achieve goals for climate and economic growth, negative-emissions technologies (NETs) that remove and sequester carbon dioxide from the air will need to play a significant role in mitigating climate change, says a new report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. The report calls for the launch of a substantial research initiative to advance these technologies as soon as possible. Although climate mitigation remains the motivation for global investments in NETs, the committee that carried out the study and wrote the report determined that advances in NETs also could have economic rewards, as intellectual property rights and economic benefits likely will accrue to the nations that develop the best technology.\\n“Negative emissions technologies are essential to offset carbon dioxide emissions that would be difficult to eliminate and should be viewed as a component of the climate change mitigation portfolio,” said Stephen Pacala, the Frederick D. Petrie Professor in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Princeton University and chairman of the committee. “Most climate mitigation efforts are intended to decrease the rate at which people add carbon from fossil fuel reservoirs to the atmosphere. We focused on the reverse—technologies that take carbon out of the air and put it back into ecosystems and the land. We determined that a substantial research initiative should be launched to advance these promising technologies as soon as possible.”\\nUnlike carbon capture and storage technologies that remove carbon dioxide emissions directly from large point sources such as coal power plants, NETs remove carbon dioxide (the most important greenhouse gas that causes climate change) directly from the atmosphere or enhance natural carbon sinks. Storing the carbon dioxide from NETs has the same impact on the atmosphere and climate as simultaneously preventing an equal amount of carbon dioxide from being emitted. For example, combustion of a gallon of gasoline releases approximately 10 kg of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Capturing 10 kg of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and permanently sequestering it using a NET has the same effect on atmospheric carbon dioxide as any mitigation method that simultaneously prevents a gallon of gasoline combustion. \\nThe committee concluded that the NETs available today could be safely scaled up to capture and store a significant fraction of the total emissions both in the US and globally but not enough to keep total global warming below 2°C, the target of the Paris agreement. Therefore, a concerted research effort is needed to address the constraints that currently limit deployment of NETs, such as high costs, land and environmental constraints, and energy requirements.   \\nFour land-based negative emissions technologies are ready for large-scale deployment at costs competitive with emissions mitigation strategies, the report says. These technologies include reforestation, changes in forest management, and changes in agricultural practices that enhance soil carbon storage. The fourth NET ready for scale up is bioenergy with carbon capture and sequestration—in which plants or plant-based materials are used to produce electricity, liquid fuels, or heat and any carbon dioxide that is produced is captured and sequestered.\\nHowever, these four NETs cannot yet provide enough carbon removal at reasonable cost without substantial unintended harm, the report says. Repurposing a significant amount of current agricultural land for growing new forests or feedstocks for bioenergy with carbon capture and sequestration could have significant effects on food availability. Repurposing tropical forest would harm biodiversity. Research could identify ways to soften the land constraint, for instance, by developing crop plants that take up and sequester carbon more efficiently in soils or by reducing food waste or demand for meat. \\nTwo other negative emissions technologies could be revolutionary, the committee said, because they have high potential capacity to remove carbon. Direct air capture uses chemical processes to capture carbon dioxide from the air, concentrate it, and inject it into a storage reservoir. However, it is currently limited by high cost. There is no commercial driving force for developing direct air capture technologies; therefore, developing a low-cost option will require sustained government investment. Carbon mineralization—which essentially accelerates weathering so carbon dioxide from the atmosphere forms a chemical bond with reactive minerals—is currently limited by lack of fundamental understanding.

In steady-state operations, Gorgon is expected to have the lowest greenhouse-gas-emissions intensity of any LNG project in Australia, Chevron said.\\nGorgon is one of the world's largest LNG projects, with a three-train, 15.6-mpta LNG facility. The project develops the offshore Gorgon and Jansz-Io fields. Gorgon gas contains 14% naturally occurring reservoir carbon dioxide.\\nGas from Gorgon and Jansz-Io is transported via subsea pipeline to Barrow Island, where carbon dioxide is separated from gas during the liquefaction process. The carbon dioxide is compressed and transported via pipeline for injection into the Dupuy formation, a sandstone reservoir, which is 2.5-km deep. Chevron said injected carbon dioxide is monitored by observation wells, ongoing seismic surveys, and other technology.\\nThe Australian government has contributed $60 million toward the capital cost of the injection project as part of the country’s Low Emissions Technology Demonstration Fund.\\nThe Australian subsidiaries of Chevron operate the Gorgon Project with a 47.3% stake.

              "  'content': 'A new joint study will test the economic viability of taking CO2 from a cement plant and giving it to an oil company to pump underground.\\nOccidental Petroleum (Oxy) and Total announced this week they are leading a consortium to assess the viability of a commercial-scale carbon-capture facility built specifically for cement operations.\\nThe joint study will evaluate the cost of a facility capable of capturing 725,000 tonnes of CO2 per year from a cement plan in Florence, Colorado. Emissions from the plant, owned by the Swiss multinational company LafargeHolcim, are to be sequestered underground by Oxy. This implies that the Houston-based operator may use the CO2 for its expansive enhanced oil recovery (EOR) projects in Texas.\\nRounding out the consortium is Svante, developer of the carbon sequestration technology that will be put to use in the pilot. Founded in 2007 and based in the Vancouver area, Svante says its process can “catch and release” CO2 from a flue gas stream within 60 seconds.\\nA key enabler is the firm’s solid adsorbent nanomaterial, which allows it to maintain a smaller inventory of material compared with traditional liquid solvents that are commonly used for CO2 scrubbing. A sugar-cube sized amount of the solid nanomaterial has the equivalent surface area of a football field.\\nThe agreement to launch the study is the latest in a string of oil and gas investments made in the area of carbon capture, use, and storage (CCUS). Oxy is participating in the project through its Oxy Low Carbon Ventures group that was formed to help the company expand its core business of hydrocarbon extraction while lowering or offsetting its overall greenhouse gas emissions.\\nTotal said it plans to spend 10% of its annual research and development budget this year on CCUS technology, which it considers essential to curbing worldwide emissions.\\nIn addition to this project, Oxy is funding other low-carbon technologies including a newly opened solar facility. Oxy is working with Canadian startup Carbon Engineering to construct what will be the world’s largest “direct air capture” facility in the Permian Basin. The stated goal of this project is to extract CO2 from the atmosphere and use it to support Oxy’s EOR operations.\\nTotal, Svante, and LafargeHolcim partnered last year on a similar project that seeks to capture carbon from a cement plan in British Colombia, Canada. This project is focused on re-injecting the captured CO2 into concrete.\\nSvante and Husky Energy completed a 30 ton-per-day demonstration plant last summer at the Pikes Peak South thermal project for an estimated cost of $15 million. Sanctioned in 2012, the project seeks to reduce the carbon intensity of heavy oil extraction and has the potential to expand to cover more of the area’s operations, which support a growing production base of 37,000 B/D.'},\n",

The industry’s operations account for 9% of all human-made greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions. In addition, it produces the fuels that create another 33% of global emissions.\\nSeveral trends are focusing the minds of industry executives. One is that investors are pushing companies to disclose consistent, comparable, and reliable data. Activist shareholders, for example, are challenging US- and Europe-based oil majors on their climate policies and emissions-reduction plans. Investors are also increasingly conscious of environmental issues. In the five markets examined by the Global Sustainable Investment Alliance—Australia and New Zealand, Canada, Europe, Japan, and the United States—sustainable investments reached assets of $30.7 trillion in early 2018, one-third of total investment. At September’s UN climate summit, an alliance of the world’s largest pension funds and insurers (representing $2.4 trillion in assets) committed itself to transitioning its portfolios to net-zero emissions by 2050.\\nAt the same time, renewable technologies have been getting cheaper. In the United States, the cost of solar—both photovoltaics and utility scale—has fallen more than 70% since 2011, and the cost of wind by almost two-thirds. By 2025, they could be competitive with natural-gas-based power generation in many more regions.\\nOther forces are also coming into play. Although there is still no global market, carbon taxes or trading systems cover 20% of worldwide emissions, compared with 15% in 2017, according to the World Bank. Many European governments plan to implement binding GHG emissions targets and are drawing up national energy and climate plans.'},\n",

              "  'content': 'The offshore drilling contractor’s latest effort to curb emissions relies on technology developed during the US space shuttle program and could become commercial by 2022.\\nTo offset the carbon footprint of its operations in places such as offshore Malaysia and the North Sea, Denmark-based Maersk Drilling is turning to California. The offshore drilling contractor announced this week that it will invest $1 million in a company called Clean Energy Systems that is developing a new combustion technology for the industrial sector.\\nIt uses biomass fuel to produce syngas from which hydrogen and methane can be separated for sales. Based in the Sacramento area, Clean Energy Systems says the hydrogen-depleted syngas can be burned to make electricity, the associated CO2 emissions of which is then fully captured and can be used for enhanced oil recovery or stored in the ground.\\nBecause the system uses biomass fuel, e.g., forestry or agricultural waste, that consumed CO2 over its organic lifetime and enables CO2 storage, the process is considered by the companies to be a net-negative emission solution. But since the technology is not designed to operate on a drilling rig, Maersk Drilling will instead seek to leverage it by generating carbon credits that will offset its emissions elsewhere.\\n“By investing in Clean Energy Systems’ concept, we are helping to bring alive a new technology which can remove CO2 from the atmosphere. We believe the world needs a broad portfolio of technologies and solutions to meet the challenge posed by climate change, and by engaging in this project, we support the development of carbon capture and storage in a way that could allow us to progress towards carbon-neutral drilling,” said Morten Kelstrup, the chief operating officer of Maersk Drilling.\\nThe emerging technology is based around the rocket engines used on the space shuttle along with other combustion technologies that produce high-energy gases. The full suite includes high-pressure, high-temperature steam-gas generators, turboexpanders, reheaters, and heat exchangers that were built using rocket-engine combustion principles.\\nClean Energy Systems said its first commercial project will begin by late 2020 and will capture and store 300,000 tons of CO2 annually.\\nIn addition to this recent investment, Maersk Drilling has joined a consortium in Denmark to advance CO2 sequestration. It also is developing the first offshore rig to operate using onshore power sources and is upgrading two jackup rigs to become hybrid units that will operate with lower emissions.'},\n",

              "  'content': 'To go big on capturing CO2, the oilfield service company is acquiring a company that specializes in going small.\\nBaker Hughes is buying a startup called Compact Carbon Capture to bolster its energy transition strategy, the company said today in an announcement.\\nBaker Hughes described carbon-capture technology as “critical” for the energy industry and that it “is among the most viable decarbonization paths” for both retrofitting existing assets and greenfield projects.”\\n“We are positioning our portfolio for new energy frontiers, and we believe there will be strong growth potential of carbon capture for both industrial applications and oil and gas projects,” Baker Hughes’ Chief Executive Officer Lorenzo Simonelli said in the statement.\\nThe Bergen-based Compact Carbon Capture is developing technology that it hopes to someday install at industrial sites around the world.\\nTrue to its name, its core product is a modular CO2-capturing system that relies on high-speed rotating solvent-based beds that rely on static-based columns to absorb the greenhouse gas. The company said that compared to the traditional technologies, its platform requires 75% less area to achieve the same throughput.\\nThe smaller footprint that this concept affords opens its potential market to crowded refineries or facilities notorious for having limited real estate, such as offshore oil and gas platforms. Outside of oil and gas, Compact Carbon Capture is targeting waste-to-energy plants and ship installations.\\nSimonelli added that Baker Hughes will incubate the technology to a point that the company can offer “one of the industry’s lowest cost-per-ton carbon-capture solutions.”\\nBaker Hughes did not disclose terms of the deal. The announcement implied that both companies are exploring synergies with Baker Hughes’ existing line of turbomachinery that was inherited from its previous owner GE.\\nCompact Carbon Capture was founded in 2018 but its roots trace back to technology patented in 1999 and a subsequent research and development project funded by Equinor in 2007. The company was also part of Spanish oil company Repsol’s technology accelerator program.'},\n",

Here’s how they can excel at both.\\nBack in the early stages of the pandemic, a high-ranking executive at GALP told me the Portuguese company was positioning itself to become “the Amazon of Energy,” explaining that a fully digitalized operation and a diverse portfolio of products and services that extend well beyond GALP’s oil and gas roots would enable the company to thrive, even in the face of extreme disruption.\\nNow, more than 2 years later, the disruption in energy markets has indeed reached extreme levels due to the war in Ukraine, inflation, economic uncertainty, changing climate, the global push to decarbonize, and yes, even the remnants of the COVID-19 pandemic. All of which is testing the ability of oil, gas, and energy companies to respond to rapidly changing market signals and energy priorities.\\nDoing business in highly volatile market conditions has long been a strong suit for hydrocarbon-focused energy companies. Now, amid a unique confluence of factors, these companies are being asked to be more responsive, agile, and Amazon-like than they have ever been, with the ability to rapidly read the signals they’re getting from the market, from geopolitical forces and other sources, then respond, reprioritize, reallocate, and scale accordingly. That could mean producing and exporting more liquefied natural gas supplies for the European market to fill the void left by Russia, for example, or accelerating timelines for renewable energy production projects to reduce reliance on coal for electricity generation.\\nHow can traditionally hydrocarbon-focused companies answer the call—and in doing so, take advantage of the opportunities that today’s unique market dynamics present? I see five keys to maintaining a high level of operational and supply chain readiness, without compromising near-term or long-term profitability.'},\n",

              "  'content': \"The latest signs that momentum is building in the geothermal space include military bases.\\nA quartet of geothermal developers made headlines this week with agreements that could lead to defense contracts, and one that received new funding.\\nThe US Department of Defense (DoD) has recently expanded its geothermal initiative with the inclusion of three new companies—Fervo Energy, GreenFire Energy, and Sage Geosystems.\\nThe initiative aims to reduce the military's carbon footprint and enhance energy self-sufficiency. Plans are underway for early-stage studies by these companies at military installations across California, Nevada, and Texas.\\nFervo Energy, which specializes in enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) utilizing modern horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing technologies, will explore the feasibility of drilling and completing EGS wells at the US Naval Air Station Fallon in Nevada.\\nThe selection follows reports earlier this year that Fervo issued government filings showing it has raised approximately $138.5 million of a targeted $221 million in equity financing. The Houston-based company recently highlighted that drilling costs at its Project Cape in Utah have dropped by nearly half, from $9.4 million to $4.8 million per well.\\nSage Geosystems is also set to conduct a feasibility study at the US Fort Bliss Army Base in Texas. Sage's approach targets shallower hot dry-rock formations than typical geothermal projects. The company secured $17 million in Series A funding this year and is collaborating with Texas electric regulators to develop a 3-MW subsurface energy storage system by year's end. This innovative system plans to use injected fluids that are stored under pressure to generate electricity on demand.\\nCalifornia-based GreenFire Energy, which develops closed-loop geothermal technology that avoids contact with subsurface water, will evaluate the deployment of its systems at the US Naval Air Facility in El Centro, California. GreenFire is supported by several investors, including Baker Hughes, which has helped test the technology at its testing facility in Oklahoma City.\\nThese companies join four others—Eavor, Teverra, Zanskar Geothermal and Minerals Inc.—previously selected by the DoD, which are now at various stages of project evaluation in Alaska, California, Idaho, and Texas.\\nIn a separate announcement, GA Drilling said this week it raised $15 million from investors following successful geothermal drilling technology tests. Key participants include existing investor global drilling rig contractor Nabors, along with several private investors. The capital injection will support GA Drilling's efforts to commercialize its AnchorBit technology, capable of reaching drilling depths of 4 to 5 km, which the firm claims will extend the current economic limits of many geothermal wells by at least 1 km.\\nGA Drilling is also in discussions to help create a 12-MW geothermal power plant in Lower Saxony, Germany. This project is so far working under a nonbinding memorandum of understanding signed in February.\"},\n",
